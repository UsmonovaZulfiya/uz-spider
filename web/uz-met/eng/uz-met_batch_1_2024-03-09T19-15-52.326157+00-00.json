Today, we are pleased to welcome you, dear friends, in a completely new environment of the NEW UZBEKISTAN, which is opening up to the world and is committed to cooperation in all areas.\nWe can say with confidence that in recent years we have made great strides in honoring human dignity, liberalizing the economy and confidently accessing world markets.\nIn particular, we have completely abolished forced labor and child labor to ensure in practice that human rights are regarded as supreme value.\nOur practical results in ensuring freedom of speech and belief, gender equality are recognized by the international community.\nFor the first time, we admitted the existence of poverty in our country and put an effective system in place to reduce it. The families in need of state social support have been fully covered by this system.\nIn addition, we are resolutely continuing reforms aimed at ensuring the rule of law, strengthening judicial independence and fair justice, and guaranteeing the inviolability of private property.\nThe administrative courts have been set up as part of a system of reliable protection of the interests of citizens and entrepreneurs.\nCreating an atmosphere of intolerance for corruption in society has become one of our top priorities.\nOur economic reforms are increasingly reflecting the simplicity and opportunities long awaited by our foreign investors and partners.\nWe have been able to double our foreign trade turnover through liberalization of the currency system, removal of barriers to access foreign markets, and abolition of customs duties on more than 7,000 raw materials and goods.\nAt the same time, international organizations have recognized that the tax burden has been reduced almost two-fold, tax administration has been simplified, and Uzbekistan has established the most attractive fiscal system in our region.\nThanks to increased confidence in our reforms, the annual volume of foreign investment has tripled compared to 2017.\nOverall, creation of a favorable business environment in the country has enabled quadruple increase in the number of entrepreneurs (from 485 thousand to 2 million people).\nMost importantly, our people fully support our political and economic reforms.\nOur updated Constitution, recently adopted by a nationwide referendum, firmly guarantees the irreversibility and sustainability of reforms.\nIn short, we will go forward more boldly without deviating from our chosen long-term path of openness and sustainable development.\nFirst. We will improve the investment and business climate in our country and create a more favorable environment for investors through an integrated system.\nIn this regard, the Foreign Investors Council under the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan will be a key link in establishing direct communication with foreign investors and joint development of mutually beneficial projects and long-term strategies.\nThere is no doubt that this dialogue platform established in cooperation with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will bring us new experiences, create new opportunities and promote new approaches for our reforms.\nWherever the investors are, they will be provided with the necessary assistance and services in 14 regions, 208 districts and cities, as well as in all embassies of Uzbekistan abroad, through the \"single window\" established at the Ministry of Investment.\nBy the end of the year, the International Commercial Court will also be established in cooperation with international experts, which will be for the first time in our history.\nSecond. We will vigorously pursue a policy of further liberalization of goods, services, capital and labor markets.\nIn particular, we have made great efforts to become a member of the World Trade Organization so that we can be part of global production and supply chains.\nI believe that we will achieve significant results in this direction this year.\nThird. Reduction of excessive bureaucracy and \"uprooting corruption\" will remain at the focus of attention of our state and society.\nBy persistently continuing the administrative reforms initiated in this regard, we will introduce a compact and efficient public administration system that will help people and businesses and provide them with high-quality services.\nDear governors!\nWe need to honestly say the following. The support of our international partners has been key in implementing our reforms and achieving our current results.\nToday, I can say with absolute confidence that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has become our strategic partner on the path of sustainable development of Uzbekistan.\nIn particular, the fact that the Bank\u2019s project portfolio in our country has exceeded 4 billion euros, of which 3.3 billion euros worth projects were launched in the last four years alone, vividly testifies to this statement.\nBy the end of last year, Uzbekistan joined the ranks of the Bank\u2019s top five major partners.\nIn terms of an annual volume of investments, Uzbekistan became the Bank\u2019s largest business partner in Central Asia.\nMost importantly, our approaches and goals for private sector development are aligned with those of the Bank.\nThe fact that now the share of private business in the Bank\u2019s projects in our country has reached 55% is clear evidence of this alignment.\nOur cooperation is rapidly developing in such areas as green energy, potable water, road transport, and ecology, which are vitally important today.\nIn particular, we have launched large-scale projects in the field of renewable energy involving 600 million euros of the Bank\u2019s funds.\nThis active cooperation serves as a \"catalyst\" in attracting other foreign investors to our economy.\nTaking this opportunity, I would like to express my deep gratitude:\nto the management of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, particularly the President of the Bank, Madam Renaud-Basso,\nto the governments and governors of the Bank\u2019s member states,\nto the organizations and investors cooperating with the Bank,\nto all the staff members of the Bank who carry out projects with us.\nDear friends!\nAs we continue our reforms, we look forward to cooperating with development partners, including the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, in the following areas.\nFirst. In ensuring the sustainable economic development of our country, we build on the private sector alone.\nIn this regard, we well realize that our future progress is closely interlinked with privatization processes.\nTo this end, at the beginning of the year, we set ambitious targets in terms of selling the state shares in enterprises, putting up the shares of strategic companies and large banks for auction.\nIn particular, 40 enterprises of strategic importance to our economy will hold an IPO.\nIn this direction, we will implement an extensive program with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\nOne example, we are actively cooperating with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in the privatization of the largest banks in our country \u2013 the \"Uzbek Industrial and Construction Bank\" and the \"Asaka Bank\".\nIn addition, we have launched a special program in cooperation with the Bank for the effective use of our country\u2019s natural resources, attracting investors with the latest technologies.\nWe have set ambitious goals for poverty reduction.\nTo accomplish them we will create new opportunities and conditions for entrepreneurs.\nTo this end, we are interested in further expanding our cooperation with the Bank to provide financial support to small and medium-sized businesses.\nSecond. Expanding public-private partnership projects in areas such as infrastructure, medicine, education, transport and ecology.\nIn this regard, for the first time in our country, we are launching projects with the Bank to manage the drinking water network in Namangan and to build the modern \"Tashkent-Samarkand\" highway.\nWe will expand public-private partnership in tourism, which is a highly promising sector as well.\nI believe that staying here in Samarkand, you can feel for yourselves that enormous tourist potential that our country possesses.\nIn general, more than 40 major private-public partnership projects in the fields of healthcare, education, infrastructure, transport, and energy will be presented at this Conference.\nI am confident that you will find these projects interesting.\nThird, the rapid development of the green economy, especially the green energy sectors.\nWe intend to increase the share of renewables in electricity production by 40% by 2030.\nIn this regard, 3 large solar power plants with a total capacity of 1.2 gigawatt will be built this year with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\nAt the same time, the ancient Samarkand, which is hosting today's conference, has recently been included in the Bank\u2019s \"Green Cities\" Program.\nWe will count on the Bank\u2019s support in including our cities such as Nukus, Andijan, Bukhara and Namangan in this program.\nFourth, we are paying special attention to further supporting women's entrepreneurship in the New Uzbekistan and creating equal opportunities for the implementation of their ideas and initiatives.\nIn this regard, our programs to ensure women\u2019s employment and economic empowerment, which are being implemented with the Bank, deserve special attention.\nWe will further expand our cooperation with the Bank to dramatically increase the number of such projects.\nFifth, together with the Bank, we are ready to implement many more new projects on new agrotechnologies, water conservation and food security.\nI believe that such projects will be beneficial for both the Bank and investors in the current environment of increasing global food shortages.\nDear participants of the conference!\nWe have defined the development of cooperation in Central Asia as one of the most priority directions in the foreign policy of the New Uzbekistan.\nToday, Central Asia is becoming a bright example of good neighborliness and partnership thanks to the strong political will of the leaders of the regional countries and our consistent efforts.\nIn particular, to develop economic relations with our neighbors, we have set up joint investment funds and launched a number of major projects in industry, energy, transport and water management.\nWe invite the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and other foreign partners to actively participate in these regional projects.\nLadies and gentlemen!\nI would like to conclude by emphasizing one last point. Today's International Conference is creating a historic opportunity to elevate the cooperation between the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and our country to a new level.\nAt the same time, I am confident that visits of representatives of the governments of 71 countries to Samarkand will give a great impetus to launching mutually beneficial projects with them as well.\nToday's \"Presentation of Investment Potential of Uzbekistan\" has demonstrated in detail the great business opportunities that our country can offer.\nIn addition, new projects will be presented to you in detail at the sessions and meetings held as part of the conference.\nI believe that each and every participant of the Conference will discover new ways of doing business in Uzbekistan.\nIn addition, the ancient and rich history of our country, unique cultural heritage, hospitable and sincere people will leave an unforgettable impression on you.\nI wish you all good health and happiness, the best of luck in your endeavors, and great success to the conference.\nThank you for your attention.\n\nSource:\n\n\n\nPress Service of JSC \u201cNational Electric Grid of Uzbekistan\u201d", "creation_date": "18.05.2023", "access_date": "2024-03-10 00:15:53"},

We have achieved a \u201cmature\u201d cooperation based on trust, respect and consideration of each other's interests.\nThe volume of mutual trade and investment has increased hundreds of times, we have many successful examples of business cooperation and humanitarian exchange.\nI will say more: our countries are time-tested, real friends of China \"beyond the Yangguan Pass.\"\nDear summit participants!\nWe support the agenda of the meeting and the main provisions of the Xi'an Declaration.\nI believe that the initiatives and proposals voiced today will certainly be practically implemented.\nIn this regard, I share the opinion on the importance of establishing the effective interaction mechanisms in the main areas of regional cooperation. We are talking primarily about trade, investment, transport, and humanitarian ties.\nAlong with this, I believe it is vital to develop a long-term agenda, long-range plans and tasks for multifaceted cooperation for decades ahead.\nIn my opinion, special attention should be paid to the development of joint work of the leading \"think tanks\" of our countries.\nThe analytical institutions, scientists and specialists need to develop strategic approaches, comprehensive recommendations and solutions, \"breakthrough\" projects of a regional and global scale.\nWe are ready to provide a discussion platform and hold the First International Expert Conference in Samarkand next year on adjoining our national strategies of development.\nDear colleagues!\nI would like to share our vision of the most pressing issues of regional cooperation.\nFirst of all, this is the creation of conditions for the sustainable development of our countries and the region as a whole.\nHere we pay major attention to improving the living standards of the population and the efficiency of poverty reduction.\nActive use of the advanced Chinese practice in our relevant national program helped to remove last year alone more than one million of our citizens from the category of people in need.\nYesterday, the distinguished President of the People's Republic of China and I agreed to continue working together to achieve the main goal of the Global Development Initiative.\nI am confident that the adoption and implementation of a joint program with specific tasks to improve living standards and local growth, especially in rural areas, will be supported by our peoples and it will become a common contribution to the achievement of the Global Goals and 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nWe stand for the establishment of a new economic dialogue and strengthening the interconnectedness of our countries.\nWe consider it quite achievable to double the trade turnover of the countries of the region with China by 2030, primarily through:\n-\u00a0balanced growth of mutual supply of industrial goods and agricultural products;\n-\u00a0formation of an efficient trade and logistics infrastructure, modern wholesale and distribution networks;\n-\u00a0introduction of the system of \"green\" and express corridors, creation of common e-commerce platforms.\nWe note the importance of holding annual export and import exhibitions, business and investment forums in our countries, and the creation of the Business Council of Central Asia and China.\nIn order to create favorable conditions and the necessary legal framework, we propose to consider the possibility of adopting a multilateral Agreement on Promotion of Mutual Trade and Investments.\nThe issues of deepening industrial cooperation, attracting digital technologies and introducing innovations, especially in agriculture, can be effectively resolved through direct interregional contacts with the provinces of China.\nI propose to hold this year in Uzbekistan a Forum and an exhibition of cities and regions of our countries this year in order to develop practical cooperation, strengthening sister city and partnership relations.\nThe development of safe and shortest transport corridors connecting China with our region, with the access to Europe, Middle East and South Asia is of strategic importance.\nThe priority project for the revival of the \"Great Silk Road\" is the Trans-Eurasian Highway, the key components of which will be the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan automobile and railroad.\nWe have already been moving to the stage of practical work together with our Chinese and Kyrgyz partners.\nIn the future, the implementation of this project and the construction of the Trans-Afghan Corridor will allow to connect China with the countries of South Asia by alternative ways within the Belt and Road Initiative.\nWe also consider it a top priority to ensure the integration of national programs for the development of transport communications and, on this basis, to develop a single long-term Strategy.\nI propose to pay special attention to cooperation on the climate agenda and green energy.\nUnfortunately, the pace of energy infrastructure development in Central Asia doesn\u2019t match the pace of industrialization and urbanization, as well as demographic growth.\nToday, this is indeed a very serious challenge to the long-term sustainable development of our countries.\nTaking into account the technological leadership of China in the field of solar, wind and hydropower, as well as the existing financial instruments to support projects, we consider it necessary to expand scientific and practical partnership in alternative energy.\nWe are also ready for productive cooperation in solving the environmental problems of the Aral Sea region, protecting biodiversity, preserving glaciers and soil, and introducing water-saving technologies.\nDear participants of the meeting!\nWe highly appreciate the current level of regional dialogue on stability and security. We adhere a principled position on the issues of independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of our countries.\nUzbekistan supports China's global initiative based on the principles of indivisibility of security and peaceful development in accordance with the UN Charter.\nWe propose to develop close cooperation between the intelligence and law enforcement agencies of the Central Asian states and China in the fight against the forces of three evils, drug trafficking, cross-border and cybercrime.\nWe consider it essential to fully use the dialogue platforms of the Contact Group within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and Afghanistan\u2019s neighbor-states to develop a coordinated position and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in that country.\nAs you noted yesterday, Mr. Xi Jinping, \"it is important to jointly promote issues related to assisting to build an inclusive political system in Afghanistan, to establish full-scale counter-terrorism cooperation between our countries.\u201d\nWe also count on the support of our initiative to establish a high-level international group under the auspices of the United Nations to develop an algorithm for fulfilling the mutual obligations of the world community and the current Afghan authorities.\nFor regular comparing notes we propose to launch a mechanism for meetings of secretaries of security in our format.\nDear friends!\nOur countries and peoples have a huge civilizational potential and great opportunities for mutual enrichment of national cultures.\nAnother evidence of that was the bright concert held yesterday as part of the opening of the Year of Culture and Arts and the Youth Festival of Central Asia and China.\nI consider it important to continue a good tradition of the regular holding of humanitarian exchanges, various exhibitions, concerts and tours, joint sports events with the wide involvement of young people.\nWe propose next year to hold together the Forum of Young Talents of our countries.\nI express my gratitude to the Chinese side for the major initiatives and joint programs in the field of traditional medicine, eye disease treatment and education.\nDear colleagues,\nHeads of Delegations!\nOur countries are strategic partners and reliable friends.\nOur long-term cooperation, based on the principles of trust, respect and consideration of each other's interests, has never depended on the political situation.\nToday, in the face of increasing confrontation and unpredictability in international relations, we provide mutual support and build together a prosperous future for our peoples.\nA clear confirmation of such special relations is the effective assistance of our countries to each other during the pandemic.\nIn this regard, I would like to support the strategic initiative of the Chinese side to hold our meetings regularly in order to strengthen friendship and partnership between the states of Central Asia and China.\nMr. President Xi Jinping, You are the wise leader of great China and a sincere supporter of security, stability and prosperity in our region and in the world as a whole. Our meetings are clear evidence of this.\nI am confident that the fruitful outcomes of today's Summit will serve to strengthen good-neighborly relations and comprehensive cooperation, and to the prosperity of our countries and peoples.\nThank you for your attention.\n\nSource:\n\nInformation Service of JSC \"National Electric Grid of Uzbekistan\"\nt.me/uzmetaxborotxizmati", "creation_date": "19.05.2023", "access_date": "2024-03-10 00:15:54"},

Shavkat Mirziyoyev at the 16th Summit of Economic Cooperation Organization", "text": "\nDistinguished heads of delegations!\nEsteemed secretary general!\nDear participants of the summit!\nI am delighted to see you at the Summit of the Economic Cooperation Organization.\nWelcome to Uzbekistan!\nToday\u2019s top-level meeting is a vivid testimony of our strong commitment to expand multilateral cooperation for the benefit of common development.\nNowadays the world\u2019s political architecture is indeed changing in front of our eyes and its global transformation is underway.\nIt is crucially important for member states of our Organization, which have their important place in these complex processes, to act together in unity and seek for effective solutions to emerging challenges and threats.\nDuring our Summit under the slogan\n\u201cThrough Cooperation to Economic Stability and Development\u201d,\nwe will have a detailed discussion with you, my distinguished colleagues, on how to take our multilateral relations to a new level and address the most topical issues.\nI would like to express my special gratitude to all of you for your participation in today\u2019s event and for your great contribution to the development of our mutually beneficial relations.\nTaking this opportunity, I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to the\nPresident of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev\non his successful chairmanship in our Organization.\nA series of events and initiatives that took place as part of the\n\u201cYear of Green Transition and Connectivity\u201d\nunder Azerbaijan\u2019s Chairmanship have made a significant contribution to the expansion of our practical partnership.\nWe fully support the plans and objectives of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which assumes the chairmanship of our Organization for the next year, to deepen cooperation through the facilitation of regional trade.\nDear colleagues!\nNow, with your permission, I will take the floor first as the host of the Summit.\nDear participants of the summit!\nWe successfully held the 15th Summit of our Organization in Ashgabat precisely two years ago.\nThe important decisions adopted at our meeting in Turkmenistan gave a fresh perspective to the activities of our Organization.\nA systemic work is underway to transform the Organization to increase its efficiency and international profile.\nIn particular, I would like to highlight the importance of the\nTashkent Declaration\nadopted by our Ministers of Transport.\nA practical work is underway to set up a Clean Energy Center in Baku and a regional electricity market.\nA high-level Dialogue platform for ecology has been established.\nIn order to further expand cooperation in tourism a network of the Organization\u2019s tour operators has been set up and the Safe Tourism Program has been approved for the first time ever.\nDistinguished heads of delegations!\nThe member-states of Organization are closely linked by common history and the holy religion of Islam, and they share rich culture and similar values.\nOur vast region, which is home to half a billion people, has a great potential for developing cooperation in trade, economy, industry, investment, innovation and transport.\nAccording to the analysis, our economies are maintaining stable growth rates despite the global crisis.\nYou are all well aware that in recent years Uzbekistan is implementing irreversible reforms.\nOur priority is to liberalize the economy and improve the living standards and prosperity of our people.\nOver the past six years the GDP of New Uzbekistan has increased one and a half times.\nBy 2030 we seek to double this indicator.\nWe intend to achieve this target primarily by creating \u201cgreen\u201d economy and a modern infrastructure, providing incentives to the private sector, creating new jobs, and actively attracting foreign investment.\nIn this regard, we are ready for effective cooperation with all member-states of our Organization, which have their own voice and prestige in the international arena.\nAs the economies of our close and good neighborly countries can complement one another. Common trade and transport corridors as well as energy networks inextricably connect our countries.\nWe certainly will achieve significant results in the future by finding together new \u201cpoints of growth\u201d.\nDear participants of the summit!\nUzbekistan is in favor of summarizing the implementation of the ECO Vision- 2025, the framework document of our Organization.\nWe believe that it is high time for developing the\n\u201cStrategic Objectives of Economic Cooperation-2035\u201d.\nThis conceptual document will define the future priority areas of engagement for our Organization, building on a thorough analysis of the enormous and still untapped opportunities.\nThis important document will highlight the following main areas.\nFirst.\nPromotion of mutual trade.\nLast year, the trade turnover between our countries totaled $85 billion.\nThis represents only 8% of the total foreign trade of the Organization\u2019s member-states.\nRegrettably, the years of efforts to develop a preferential trade agreement have not delivered the expected results.\nThere are still many restrictions and problems to barrier-free trade.\nWe must openly admit this and take a new perspective to turn the situation into a positive shift.\nIn this regard, I would like to encourage for the adoption of the\nECO\u2019s Trade Facilitation Agreement\ndeveloped by our experts.\nThis document shall focus on the following:\n-\u00a0facilitation of trade in goods and services;\n-\u00a0removal of technical and non-tariff barriers;\n-\u00a0digitalization of customs, phytosanitary, and veterinary procedures;\n-\u00a0development of electronic commerce.\nAccording to preliminary estimates, these measures will enable reaching at least a twofold growth in mutual trade by 2035.\nSecond.\nStrengthening transport and communication connectivity.\nThe majority of the member states are landlocked.\nIn addition, we need to fully utilize the potential of transcontinental transport corridors that pass through our territories and link us with major markets in the Asia-Pacific region, South Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.\nThe launch of the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan and Trans-Afghan multimodal roads in the coming future meets the interests of all member states.\nI also encourage other members to join the document, adopted at the meeting of transport ministers held on November 2, 2023 in Tashkent on the development of\n\u201cUzbekistan - Turkmenistan-Iran\u2013Turkiye\u201d Transport Corridor,\nand optimize mutual tariffs and fees.\nIt is worth noting that Uzbekistan has digitized freight documents with Azerbaijan and Turkiye and is implementing similar projects with other countries.\nI propose to establish ECO\u2019s\nDigital Transport and Customs Office in Tashkent\nin order to widely implement and effectively coordinate these modern systems.\nThird.\nPromotion of industrial cooperation and business ties, forming industrial hubs.\nWe have developed the\nProgram of Joint Actions\nto increase the flow of mutual investments, ensure their protection, and deepen industrial cooperation. The document has been submitted to the Secretariat of the Organization.\nThe Program seeks to promote new joint projects in the fields of chemistry, energy, geology, textiles, leather, footwear, food, pharmaceuticals, and construction.\nWe wish to expand our partnership with the ECO\nTrade and Development Bank\nfor this noble cause.\nThe\nFifth Business Forum,\nwhich was held yesterday in Tashkent and attended by heads of chambers of commerce and industry and many of our companies clearly demonstrated the great potential we have in the private sector.\nWe propose to establish within ECO an\nInterregional Industrial Exhibition\nand hold its first event in Uzbekistan in 2024.\nFourth.\nEnsuring guaranteed energy security.\nThe harmonization of national energy strategies, the development of interregional energy transmission networks, and the widespread introduction of \u201cgreen\u201d energy technologies are becoming increasingly important.\nWe are carrying out an extensive work on the development of renewable energy sources, which is one of the main directions of Organization\u2019s Energy Cooperation Strategy.\nBy 2030, we seek to create 25 gigawatts of renewable energy sources and increase the share of renewables in our energy mix to 40%. This year alone, we are launching 2 gigawatts of large wind and solar power plants.\nWe are also taking the initial steps in green hydrogen production. We are ready for open dialogue and exchange of experience with all countries in these areas.\nWe propose to establish a new\nCouncil of Ministers of Energy\nwithin the Organization to thoroughly discuss issues of cooperation and conduct systemic work.\nFifth.\nThe intensification of our contacts in addressing climate change and environmental protection.\nToday, our countries are facing the serious consequences of these acute problems.\nThe melting of glaciers, water scarcity, desertification, dust storms, soil erosion and the loss of biodiversity are causing serious concerns.\nI would like to extend my gratitude to all countries for supporting our initiative to establish a\nHigh-level Dialogue Platform for Ecology\nwithin the Organization.\nWe are ready to organize its first meeting as part of the Samarkand Climate Forum in 2024.\nIn addition, we invite your representatives to take an active part in the committee meeting to review the assessment of implementation of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification in our country the following week.\nI urge you to support the Samarkand Declaration to combat sand and dust storms, which are becoming a growing problem.\nSixth.\nEnhancing cooperation in the tourism sector.\nThe General Assembly of the UN World Tourism Organization recently held in Samarkand with the participation of more than 140 countries has become a historic event in attracting the attention of the world to the tourism potential of our region.\nToday, the countries of the Organization accommodate \u2013 90 UNESCO World Heritage sites, and nearly 80 million tourists visit our countries annually.\nGiven the fact that cross-border routes are becoming increasingly popular, I propose to introduce\nJoint Tourist Routes\nand increase\njoint tourist programs within the \u201cSilk Road\u201d Tourism Brand.\nI would like to propose to establish a new\nConsultative Committee on Tourism\nunder the Secretariat of the Organization, consisting of tourism departments and leading specialists of the member states. We are ready to host its first meeting next year in the city of Shakhrisabz, declared the tourism capital of our Organization.\nFurthermore, I invite member states to take advantage of the opportunities of the\nInternational Tourism Academy\nof the World Tourism Organization, opened in Samarkand.\nSeventh.\nBringing our peoples together through deepening cultural and humanitarian cooperation.\nThe annual organization of\nCulture, Arts and Cinema Weeks\nin our countries, the establishment of\nCreative Youth Festivals\nand\nInnovative Cooperation Platform,\nand the strengthening of mutual cooperation in fundamental scientific areas will effectively promote our relations.\nDistinguished participants of the summit!\nThe Israeli-Palestinian war in the Middle East, which poses a serious threat to global peace and security, is of great concern to all of us.\nRegrettably, it is the civilian population, particularly women, children, and the elderly, who suffer the most and become victims of these violent conflicts.\nThe risk of war spreading throughout the region is becoming increasingly real.\nThe conflict must not be allowed to escalate into a large-scale war.\nWe urge both sides to cease fire, start peace negotiations and come to a reasonable compromise.\nWe once again reiterate our firm position on the Palestinian people\u2019s right to have their own state, as confirmed by the UN resolutions.\nIn addition, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that Afghanistan, which is a member of our Organization, is absent in today\u2019s summit.\nIn the face of complex challenges, we cannot abandon the multiethnic people of Afghanistan, who have been our close neighbors for centuries.\nIt is imperative that we actively engage this country in the process of regional integration as a necessary condition for our sustainable development.\nI urge you all to increase humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people and address the profound social and economic problems through collective responsibility and effective mechanisms.\nDear colleagues!\nIn conclusion, I would like to underline my confidence that today's historic summit and its outcomes will transform our Organization into an efficient and impactful structure and raise our multilateral partnership to new heights.\nThank you for your attention.\nSource:\n\n\nInformation Service of JSC \"National Electric Grid of Uzbekistan\"", "creation_date": "09.11.2023", "access_date": "2024-03-10 00:15:56"},

Mr. ILHAM ALIEV for the initiative to organize the First Summit of the United Nations Special Program for the Economies of Central Asia - SPECA and for the warm hospitality.\nIt is worth underlining that under the effective chairmanship of Azerbaijan, our regional cooperation within the framework of the Program has reached a completely new level.\nThis year's Ministerial Meeting in Geneva, the \u201cSPECA Week\u201d taking place these days in Baku and, of course, today's historic Summit will serve to turn our vast region into a centre of global connectivity.\nTaking this opportunity, I would like to warmly congratulate my esteemed colleagues, distinguished representatives of the United Nations and all the participants of this event on the 25th anniversary of the establishment of our joint Programme.\nI am pleased to note that the UN General Assembly has recently adopted a special resolution on SPECA.\nDear participants of the meeting!\nThis important platform, established in Tashkent, has clearly demonstrated its utmost necessity as a practical regional partnership mechanism for achieving sustainable development goals.\nThis is reflected in the implementation of more than 400 projects aimed at expanding practical cooperation in trade, communications, transport and logistics, digitalization, energy, water resources, ecology, gender equality and other areas, as well as the adoption of trade facilitation and innovative development strategies.\nI am pleased to note that the atmosphere of good-neighborliness and trust in Central Asia has strengthened and integration has deepened, especially in recent years.\nYou are all well aware of how efficiently we, along with our esteemed colleagues, have solved difficult issues and complex problems.\nWe are currently implementing major industrial cooperation and infrastructure programs with the countries of Central Asia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Hungary.\nWe have set up joint investment companies and project financing mechanisms were created. Modern trade and logistics centers and special economic zones are being built in the border areas.\nIn this regard, I would like to appreciate the unprecedented creative work being undertaken in the regions of Azerbaijan, where historical justice has been restored with their liberation under the leadership of distinguished Ilham Aliyev.\nIndeed, I am confident that these positive and far-reaching changes open the door to new opportunities for developing our regional cooperation.\nDear heads of delegations!\nWe are well aware of the grave dangers our countries face in the context of the current global geopolitical instability.\nWe need to strengthen our regional cooperation and comprehensively support each other to effectively counter the contemporary challenges.\nIn this regard, I would like to draw your attention to the following main areas.\nFirst.\nUzbekistan is in favor of transforming the SPECA programme into an open and more effective regional platform for expanding our economic cooperation.\nTo this end, I believe that the time has come to significantly enhance the effectiveness of the working groups in the main areas of our partnership and to strengthen the institutional framework of our Programme.\nWe propose to elaborate a SPECA-2030 Development Concept together with experts of the UN Economic Commission for Europe and ESCAP.\nSecond.\nIt would be appropriate to draw up a Joint Action Plan for the Development of Regional Trade as part of our Program.\nFirst of all, we are talking about the introduction of the best practices and experiences for eliminating existing obstacles and harmonizing measures of technical regulation of export-import operations.\nAccording to the analysis, we have all opportunities to bring the mutual trade turnover between our countries from the current $52 billion to $100 billion and the share of industrial products in it \u2013 70% by 2030.\nThird.\nAs my esteemed colleagues have noted, we need to accelerate the establishment of the SPECA Trust Fund and launch its practical operations next year.\nI believe that the Fund\u2019s activities will be aimed at primarily supporting major projects in the green economy, innovation, high technology, logistics, alternative energy, smart agriculture, creation of modern social infrastructure and other relevant fields.\nThe Fund should actively cooperate with international development institutions, attract financial resources and allocate funds for priority projects and programs on the most favorable terms.\nUzbekistan is also ready to make financial contribution for the establishment of the Fund.\nFourth.\nWe support the full implementation of the Road Map adopted today and aimed at digitalizing the process of exchanging information and documents along the Trans-Caspian Multimodal Corridor.\nIn this regard, we are ready to host an International Forum \u201cDigital Transport Corridors\u201d in Uzbekistan early next year. The event will involve transport ministers, logistics companies, cargo carriers, heads of industrial enterprises, and leading experts in the field.\nTogether with specialized UN bodies, we are keen to actively promote large projects to strengthen transport connectivity in our region.\nFifth.\nWe propose to establish a Special High-Level Working Group for Food Security and hold its first meeting next year in Samarkand.\nThe agenda of this event will include such issues as developing cooperative relations between our leading agricultural industries and creating value chains, promoting scientific and technological exchange, introducing innovative resource-saving solutions, and launching \u201cexpress corridors\u201d.\nSixth.\nWe believe that it is time to adopt a new comprehensive conceptual document of SPECA - a Multilateral \u201cGreen Strategy\u201d given the fact that water, energy, ecology, and agriculture are interconnected sectors.\nNaturally, no country in our region is able to solve such acute and growing problems alone, relying solely on its own capacities.\nAccording to the UN estimates, our region is losing approximately $2 billion per year due to water scarcity.\nIf this negative process worsens and remains without comprehensive response, the per capita water availability may decrease by 25% and agricultural productivity by 40% in the future.\nSevetnh.\nI would like to request you to consider our proposal to establish a SPECA Businesswomen\u2019s Council to continuously and systematically promote active initiatives and concrete plans of businesswomen within SPECA.\nThe recent business meetings held prior to the Summit have once again demonstrated the significance of such discussions our friendly nations.\nIn addition, within the framework of the Council, I propose to present the \u201cSpeca Recognition\u201d International Award to the women who make outstanding contributions to our nations\u2019 economic development, prosperity, and mutual cooperation.\nDear participants of the summit!\nFor certain reasons, today\u2019s meeting is taking place without the participation of representatives from Afghanistan, even though this country is an integral part of Central Asia and is critical to regional stability.\nI urge my esteemed colleagues, the leadership of UNECE and ESCAP to establish working relations and restore cooperation with Afghanistan as part of the SPECA Program.\nWe cannot afford to leave this country alone with its problems. A positive outcome cannot be achieved without engaging the current Government in international dialogue.\nEsteemed colleagues!\nTaking this opportunity, I express my special gratitude to all of you for supporting a historic decision made two days ago in Paris on holding the UNESCO General Assembly session for the first time-ever in Central Asia \u2013 in the ancient city of Samarkand in 2025.\nWithin the framework of this important international forum I propose to develop a Plan of Joint Events in order to fully demonstrate to the world the great civilizational potential of the peoples of our region.\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate Uzbekistan\u2019s firm commitment to multilateral partnership within the framework of the United Nations SPECA regional program for sustainable development and prosperity of our peoples.\nThank you for your attention.\n\nSource:\n\n\nInformation Service of JSC \"National Electric Grid of Uzbekistan\"\nt.me/uzmetaxborotxizmati", "creation_date": "24.11.2023", "access_date": "2024-03-10 00:15:56"},

It is even affecting the global geopolitical landscape.\nThe adverse effects of climate change are particularly evident in Central Asia due to the Aral Sea catastrophe. In our region, the increase of temperature is twice as high as to that of global average. The number of extremely hot days has extended two times, and one third of the glaciers have completely melted down.\nThe soil erosion is impacting the livelihood of over 30 million people. Strong sand and dust storms are becoming a new normal. Water scarcity, air pollution, loss of biodiversity, and a sharp decrease in agriculture yield are ever-growing.\nThese global challenges are reaching their critical peak in our vast region.\nEsteemed participants of the summit!\nTransition to a green economy and achieving carbon neutrality are the key strategic objectives of New Uzbekistan.\nIn recent years, the share of alternative energy in our country has doubled. We are establishing 25 gigawatts of renewables capacities by 2030. We have made first practical steps on \u201cgreen\u201d hydrogen production.\nAs part of the \u201cYashil Makon\u201d (Green Space) initiative we are planting one billion trees all over the country. We have afforested over 2 million hectares on the desiccated seabed of the Aral Sea.\nWe can effectively fight against the climate change only by uniting our efforts and broad international cooperation.\nIn this regard I would like to make the following proposals.\nFirst.\nWe call for the finalization of the Global Climate Change Adaptation Framework as part of the Paris Agreement.\nWe are developing the Adaptation Strategy within the Central Asian Climate Dialogue Platform. We highly commend the important decision to create \u201cLoss and Damage\u201d Fund, which was adopted yesterday.\nSecond.\nGlobal transition to a low-carbon economy must be fair, transparent, and inclusive. The interests of developing countries must be taken into consideration.\nIt would be expedient to address this urgent problem as part of \u201cG7\u201d and \u201cG20\u201d agendas.\nThird.\nIn accordance with the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly we are keen on transforming the Aral Sea region from an environmental disaster zone to a \u201chub of innovations, technology and new opportunities\u201d.\nIn this regard I invite you all to close cooperation to set up an international Climate Technology Expo Hub.\nFourth.\nIt is critical to extensively use scientific knowledge to actively fight climate change.\nI invite leading and renowned scholars and experts from your respective countries to participate in the \u201cClimate Scientific Residence\u201d to be organized under the auspices of the \u201cGreen University\u201d in Tashkent.\nI believe that prevention of land degradation, sustainable water use and ensuring food security issues will be included in the agenda of the Residence.\nFifth.\nWe are aiming to organize a conference in Uzbekistan in 2024 on \u201cClimate Migration\u201d in cooperation with the United Nations.\nMoreover, in collaboration with the International Labour Organization we propose to develop the \u201cGreen Jobs Initiative\u201d and establish a Center for Modeling.\nWe stand ready to organize a COP Youth Conference in our country at a high level.\nEsteemed friends!\nUzbekistan remains committed to universal notions on fighting against climate change.\nFor this instance, I call for support for our initiative to hold the Samarkand International Climate Forum next year as well as to adopt a special resolution of the United Nations.\nI am convinced that the outcomes of today\u2019s summit will bring our friendly states and peoples get closer in ensuring more sustainable, prosperous and secure future for our planet.\nThank you for your attention.\n\nSource:\n", "creation_date": "02.12.2023", "access_date": "2024-03-10 00:15:56"},

Together, we have started ambitious projects.\nThe fact that today\u2019s event is being held in our country is a vivid symbolic reflection of the similarity and coherence of our goals.\nDear participants of the forum!\nCertainly, the establishment of a global award in the field of anti-corruption, which is one of the most pressing issues in a rapidly changing world, and holding award ceremony in all continents, are highly plausible.\nHence, the fight against corruption is the sacred duty of every person with integrity, every democratic society and every state.\nRecognizing the world\u2019s most active champions in the fight against corruption through this prestigious award fully aligns with the requirements of the United Nations Convention against Corruption, which was adopted precisely 20 years ago.\nLadies and gentlemen!\nLooking at the history of mankind, we can see that the evil of corruption brought the most powerful and influential countries to the brink of collapse and left them in complete chaos.\nCorruption is a dangerous threat that affects the entire humanity, the foundations of all societies and economic development, undermines the rule of law and people\u2019s trust in state policies, and hinders the development of democratic institutions.\nIn addition, it seriously threatens our plans to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.\nAccording to analysis, currently the global damage from corruption reaches nearly $3 trillion.\nHowever, I believe that these big figures do not fully reflect the true situation and the exact amount of real damage caused by corruption.\nMost frustrating thing is that nothing can measure the moral damage done to society.\nFully realizing the consequences of this acute problem, we have been closely working with influential international organizations such as the United Nations, the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nWe have been systemically implementing legal and institutional reforms to combat corruption.\nHaving passed the Anti-Corruption law, we have established a special Agency.\nWe are widely implementing preventive mechanisms aimed at ensuring the openness and transparency of government activities and increasing its responsibility, reducing bureaucracy, simplifying public services and preventing corruption.\nIn particular, compliance and performance rating systems have been introduced in all government agencies. Public procurement system has been fully digitalized.\nUzbekistan became a member of the International Open Data Charter in 2021.\nOur country is actively participating in the Istanbul Programme of Action, the Global Operational Network, the Eurasian and Egmont groups and many other platforms. It acts as the Secretariat of the West and Central Asian Asset Recovery Network.\nTashkent annually hosts the traditional International Anti-Corruption Forum.\nIn recent years our country has climbed 42 points in \u201cTransparency International\u201d index and has the highest ranking in our region. We aim to improve by another 50 points by 2030.\nIn the Open Data Inventory ranking this year we have secured the 30th place. Uzbekistan ranks the 4th in the world on Open Data Sources.\nDear participants of the forum!\nIn New Uzbekistan, where democratic reforms have become irreversible, we have also set ambitious plans and tasks to combat corruption.\nAlong the pathway of this responsible and uncompromising struggle, we are committed to mobilize all our efforts with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and all our international partners.\nFirst.\nWe will develop and implement the National Anti-Corruption Strategy 2030.\nSpecial attention will be paid to ensuring transparency, increasing accountability of public agencies, improving open data systems, and strengthening legal and institutional mechanisms.\nSecond.\nWe will actively support and participate in new regional and global projects aimed at fighting corruption.\nIn this regard, we intend to fully utilize the potential of the Regional Platform of the Convention Against Corruption, which was launched last month in Tashkent.\nAdditionally, I propose establishing a Regional Research Center for the Problems of Corruption to exchange experience, strengthen dialogue, and conduct scientific work by actively attracting non-profit and non-governmental organizations.\nThird.\nThe capacity of the Anti-Corruption Agency will be enhanced by strengthening its cooperation with similar foreign institutions.\nWe will create new mechanisms based on advanced international practices, including the establishment of an \u201cinitial inquiry\u201d institute for corruption investigations.\nFourth.\nOur priority is to raise a new generation, whose minds and hearts have been inoculated with the \u201cIntegrity Vaccine\u201d since childhood.\nIn this regard, we are interested in the wide-scale implementation of the United Nations Global Resource for Anti-Corruption Education and Youth Empowerment Program.\nFifth.\nWe appreciate the role of mass media that are on the frontlines in the fight against corruption.\nIn this regard, we believe that you will support our proposal to hold a Global Media Forum that aims to effectively harness the power of journalists in the fight against corruption and increase their influence.\nDear friends!\nIt is a very important fact that all winners of this international award are coming together for the first time and a Champions\u2019 Meeting is being organized with their participation.\nThe global efforts of the Amir of Qatar, who has shared his development achievements and profitable investments with the countries of the world and has shown steadfastness and enthusiasm in the fight against corruption, align with our noble aspirations and will certainly yield tremendous positive results.\nLike the hands, raised to stop corruption, which is reflected in this monument, we firmly shake with clear heart and conscience the hands of our determined and tireless heroes on the path of justice who are participating in today\u2019s conference.

We have created conducive opportunities for the access of the private sector and foreign companies.\nWe have established a Ministry of Energy, along with structural divisions in charge and responsible for specific area.\nHaving hired international consultants and consulting companies, for two years we thoroughly studied the possibilities for developing solar, wind and hydropower energy in our country and mapped the most promising areas.\nAs a result, the interest and trust of foreign investors in our country increased dramatically.\nFor the first time-ever, two solar stations in Karmana and Nurabad districts have been commissioned under 100 percent foreign direct investment project, and so far, one billion kilowatt hours of \u2018green\u2019 energy has been produced.\nToday, we are standing at an important event, which opens yet another bright page in the history of our country: six large solar and wind plants with a total capacity of 2,400 megawatts are to be connected to the grid.\nThe first phase of the three solar power plants has been built in Jizzakh, Samarkand and Surkhandarya regions by the UAE-based company Masdar, a close friend and partner of Uzbekistan.\nIn addition, this established and highly respected company is building a modern wind power station in the Tomdi district. Today, its 100 megawatt capacity will also be commissioned.\nGezhouba Group launches the generation of first 400 megawatts at solar power plants in Bukhara and Kashkadarya.\nRemarkably, all of these projects have been implemented on a PPI basis through foreign direct investments.\nOnce commissioned, these projects worth 2 billion US dollars, will generate 6 billion kilowatt/hour electricity and save up to 2 billion cubic meters of natural gas.\nTwo million homes will be provided with uninterrupted and guaranteed electric energy.\nIndustry and services sectors will create added value worth 4 billion USD.\nIt gives me particular pleasure to point out that the projects involving China - our strategic and large trade partner have been completed in an astonishingly short period of 9 months, which has never been witnessed in our practice.\nDespite global problems with production chains and logistics, we have managed to effectively work with companies such as Goldwind, Sungrow, Jolliwood, Lonji.\nTaking this opportunity, on behalf of our nation, I would like to express sincere gratitude to:\u00a0Mr. Mohamed Al Ramahi, Chairman, Masdar Company,\u00a0 Mr. Wu Yun, Vice-President, China Energy, and Mr. Lin Xiaodan, Chairman, Gezhouba Group,\u00a0CEOs of Dong Fang, SMAC, SEPCO and other companies, who actively participated in these projects, as well, to leading international financial institutions, all foreign and local specialists, who have made a commendable contribution to the projects.\nDear participants!\nWhy do we provide so much encouragement and pay such a great attention to the development of \u2018green\u2019 energy?\nFirst of all,\nwe have set ourselves a goal of doubling our industrial production by 2030 and raising metallurgy, petrochemicals and mechanical engineering sectors to a new quality level.\nTo this end, we intend to implement more than 500 major industrial and infrastructure projects worth $150 billion.\nTo accomplish these ambitious goals it is vitally crucial for us to have guaranteed and stable energy resources.\nWe estimate that in the next six years, our country's electricity demand will increase from the current 83 billion to 120 billion kilowatt hours. We will cover this primarily through renewable energy sources.\nSecond.\nWe are constantly seeking the ways to to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change, which has become a global problem.\nWe are actively putting forward important proposals and initiatives at international summits.\nRecently, at the UN Climate Change Conference in Dubai, the countries of the world agreed to triple the green generation.\nUzbekistan fully supports this initiative and will consistently continue its active investment policy to increase the capacity of green energy sources to 27 gigawatts by 2030.\nThird.\nOur country possesses enormous potential for green energy. We need to take advantage of this great opportunity granted by the Creator and channel it to the interests of our people.\nIn order to encourage the industry, we have launched the \u201cSolar House\u201d system to provide preferential loans and subsidies for the installation of solar panels and ensure the guaranteed purchase of generated electricity.\nThis year alone, 50,000 households and entrepreneurs have installed solar panels in our country.\nGiven that over 7 million dwellings exist in the country, I would like to point out that this creates a huge market for investors.\nFourth.\nNowadays, a special priority on a global scale is being given to products made from green energy. Green Energy certificate is being widely introduced.\nUzbekistan is making initial steps towards supplying green energy to the Asian and European markets in the future through a clear plan and steadfast efforts.\nFifth.\nThis sector will give a highly positive impetus to the development of other industries and services.\nA clear confirmation of my opinion is the fact that as part of today's projects domestic enterprises have supplied electrical equipment and construction materials worth 100 million USD.\nAs of today, four enterprises in our country have started manufacturing solar panels, two more enterprises are operating in the production of steel structures.\nAround fifty projects in green energy create an additional cable market worth 500 million USD.\nWe urge our foreign partners to strengthen cooperation with local companies in manufacturing component and spare parts.\nDear friends!\nThe tremendous work that we are undertaking today, represents yet another vivid practical result of significant reforms, started in this sector.\nBy consistently implementing these measures, we are gradually transitioning into a competitive market mechanism.\nIn particular, we have recently made an important decision to establish an energy market regulator.\nCurrently, we are actively implementing projects for construction of 22 solar and wind power stations with a total capacity of 9 gigawatts in our country.\nAt the same time, we are focusing on the infrastructure improvement for introducing new generating capacities.\nOver the next five years, a total of 70,000 kilometers of low-voltage power lines, more than 22,000 transformers, and over 100 substations will be fully renovated.\nMoreover, we will build 10,000 kilometers of new high-voltage transmission lines.\nUndoubtedly, we will further expand our fruitful cooperation with you in the future for transforming ambitious initiatives into specific projects.\nWe will create all the necessary conditions and preferences to foreign investors to implement such priority projects.\nTaking this opportunity, I sincerely congratulate all of you on the upcoming New Year 2024.\nI wish you all sound health, family happiness, and every success in all your noble endeavors.\nMay the New Year be full of joy and jubilant moments.\nThank you for your attention!\nSource:\n\nInformation Service of JSC \"National Electric Grid of Uzbekistan\"\nt.me/uzmetaxborotxizmati", "creation_date": "27.12.2023", "access_date": "2024-03-10 00:15:57"},

During the press tour, the participants got acquainted with the companies' activities in Chengdu and Xi'an.\nChina XD produces transformers with the highest voltage (1100 kW). It supplies 500 kV transformers to Uzbekistan. The organization has 11,000 employees. More than 1,000 workers work around the clock in two modes in the production of transformers. It is noteworthy that the company does not just export transformers but also takes into account the territory, location, and other features of the country where they are ordered, after which it collects them for at least 4 months. The second address of the company is located in Xi'an City, where large-sized electrical devices and generators are manufactured. This network is also the largest in the world in terms of direction.\nChina XD also cooperates effectively with Uzbekistan. In particular, a project for the construction and modernization of 100 substations and the construction of 110, 220, and 500 kV power transmission networks is being implemented in our republic. There is also cooperation in the production of electrical equipment in the copper cluster.\nAnother object of the press tour was the headquarters and factory of Longi in Xi'an. It should be noted that this company ranks first in the world in the production of solar panels. The company has 30 offices worldwide and 15 production bases in China, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Each of the four solar modules in the world belongs to Longi. It is the only company that has supplied more than 20 gigawatts of solar panels to foreign countries in recent years.\n\"We are ready to help with the localization of solar panels. We have studied the opportunities and incentives provided to the markets by the state. Uzbekistan has great potential in this regard in Central Asia\",\nsaid James Jin, Head of the company at Longi, in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia.\nFor information, together with Longi, a green hydrogen production technology will be launched in the Tashkent region. At the same time, natural gas will be abandoned in the production of fertilizers, thereby saving 33 thousand cubic meters of gas.\n\"Uzbekistan is a country rich in natural resources. We are working on a major, two-stage project in Uzbekistan. You have great potential in the direction of solar energy. The use of alternative energy sources is also developing. In Uzbekistan, we are working on a large, two-stage project. In the first stage, we will create energy delivery technologies with a capacity of 400 megawatts\",\nsaid \u00a0Yin Xiu An, Regional Director for Central Asia at Long Company.\nThe press tour continued at the Donfang Electric Corporation plant in Chengdu, which mainly produces gas pipes for thermal power plants. Today, the company has entered the market in more than 20 countries around the world.\nDonfang Electric Corporation is implementing two major solar energy projects in Uzbekistan. In particular, the company is the general contractor for two solar photovoltaic power plants under construction in the Kattakurgan district of the Samarkand region and the Gallaorol district of the Jizzakh region by Mastar. The power of the stations is 220 megawatts. Another corporation in China, STATE GRID, provides electricity to more than 1 billion people. She is implementing several projects in Uzbekistan.\nToday, 14% of China's electricity is produced by wind and 15% by solar energy. Soon, it is planned to cover 50% of renewable energy sources in the country. China's experience in the field of \u201cgreen energy\u201d will contribute to effective cooperation between the two countries.\n\nSource:\n\nInformation service of JSC \u00abNational Electric Grid of Uzbekistan\u00bb\n", "creation_date": "09.02.2024", "access_date": "2024-03-10 00:15:58"},

First of all, it is necessary to strengthen the trade and economic pillar of our cooperation.\nThe mutual trade between our countries constitutes only 4% of total foreign trade. And the rest of it corresponds to the share of third countries. Certainly, none of us are satisfied with this situation.\nIn addition, some import customs tariffs between our countries remain high.\nIn order to fundamentally change the situation in this strategic direction, to ensure free movement of trade, investment and services, we put forward the initiative on establishment of a \u00abspace of new economic opportunities\u00bb within our Organization.\nTo implement this plan, I propose to hold an annual International Turkic Economic Forum involving the member and observer states of our Organization as well as leading world business representatives.\nHolding the joint G2B events, business meetings and \u00abround tables\u00bb, presentations of innovative projects and exhibitions in the framework of the Forum shall yield the great practical results.\nAs an outcome of these events it will be important to adopt the annual \u00abRoad Maps\u00bb focused on the implementation of joint programs and projects.\nOur work shall be focused primarily on boosting the mutual trade and joint entry into third-country markets, creating continuous value chains, high-tech clusters and venture companies.\nWe also fully support the establishment of a joint investment fund.\nII. Another urgent issue of strategic importance on the agenda is the strengthening the transport connectivity.\nFor instance, we are speaking a lot about the transcaspian international corridor, but we have to accomplish a lot to achieve tangible results.\nFor example: Uzbekistan transports only 10% of its foreign trade goods through this transport corridor.\nIn order to fully utilize our transport and transit potential, we need to find answers to the following questions:\n- What should we do in this direction?\n- What additional measures should be taken? And when and by whom should they be taken?\nIn this regard, based on the Program adopted today, we suggest that our transport ministers develop a clear plan and effective mechanisms for joint cooperation by the end of the year.\nWe should focus on:\n- increasing the competitiveness of transit corridors in our region;\n- introducing the most favorable tariffs for business;\n- creating a modern transport infrastructure.\nIn this regard, we call on the states of our Organization to join the system of electronic transport permits exchange recently introduced between T\u00fcrkiye and Uzbekistan.\nIII. The First Turkic Agricultural Forum held this year in Tashkent has clearly shown that we have a great potential in ensuring food security.\nWe have a potential to supply with the agricultural and food products not only our countries, but also the foreign markets.\nAlong with, we should strengthen our practical steps in this direction and deepen our cooperation based on specific projects.\nIn particular, I propose the following:\nFirst, it is a high time to adopt a multilateral agreement within our Organization to create an effective system of food supply based on the needs of global and domestic markets and production capacities of our countries.\nSecond, it is important to establish a comprehensive partnership between the Organization of Turkic States and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to accelerate innovation, modern knowledge and advanced technology in the industry.\nThird, based on the positive experience to hold the Turkic Agricultural Forum on the regular basis and organize an international SMART agricultural exhibition at its second conference.\nDear summit participants!\nIV. As it was proposed by Uzbekistan, the year 2022 was declared \u00abYear of Support for Youth Initiatives\u00bb within the Organization of Turkic States.\nAs a part of this, the city of Bukhara received the status of the youth capital of the Turkic world.\nWe intend to consistently continue the good work we have started to encourage the young generation, to realize their talents and abilities.\nI propose to hold next year the International congress of science and innovation of youth of the turkic world in our country.\nWithin its framework we plan to organize the extensiv\u00a0meetings of ministers of innovation and education, rectors of universities and young leaders, talented youth, elders of our Organization.\nIn order to render a systematic tone to our work and ensure effectiveness, it would be appropriate to introduce the position of the Deputy Secretary-General of the Organization for the Youth Affairs.\nV. Another priority direction is ensuring robust security in our region.\nThe conflicts in various parts of the world are also affecting the security of the Turkic world.\nIn such a complex situation, our law enforcement agencies and security services should be in constant contact and strengthen cooperation in the areas of combating terrorism, extremism, radicalization of youth, human and drug trafficking, ensuring public and cyber security.\nAlong with this, we express our readiness to organize the next Meeting of the Secretaries of the Security Council of the states of our Organization in Uzbekistan.\nVI. I would like to draw your attention to another urgent issue.\nToday, the complex situation in neighbouring Afghanistan is, certainly, a source of great concern to all of us.\nWe should never forget about turning the situation in this country to a positive direction.\nWe encourage the regular dialogues among our Foreign Ministers to develop a common approach to the Afghan issue.\nDear friends!\nVII. I am pleased to announce today that Uzbekistan has become a full member of the international organization of turkic culture.\nWe fully endorse the proposal to hold the festival of culture of the turkic people next year as part of the Organization\u2019s celebrations of its 30th anniversary.\nWe have recently published a 100-volume book series \u00abMasterpieces of turkic literature\u00bb in the Uzbek language, consisting of a collection of literature from the member and observer-states of our Organization.\nIf we publish this priceless spiritual treasure in the languages of all member and observer-states, it shall create a solid foundation for the strengthening the ties of our brotherly countries, especially our younger generations.\nAs a part of our meeting all of us are extremely glad that for the first time the international prize of Alisher Navoi, the great poet, thinker and statesman who has made an incomparable contribution to strengthening of unity of the Turkic world, will be awarded.\nWe believe you will support our proposal to present this award annually.\nDistinguished heads of delegations!\nOur most urgent tasks are raising the activity of the Organization of Turkic States to a new quality level, increasing its authority, fully tapping the potential of our cooperation, and ensuring the implementation of our decisions and agreements.\nMany structures and various mechanisms have been established in the framework of our Organization, many ministerial level meetings and other events are being held.\nHowever, we must openly admit that we still have a lot of work to do in terms of their systematic coordination and effectiveness.\nI think that we need to join our common efforts so that our Organization shall work on the basis of a completely new, effective system in the future.\nTo this end, we propose the following institutional reforms in the organization:\n- first of all, I propose to create separate committees at the ministerial level on our priority areas: the politics and security, trade and investment, transport, agriculture, energy, information technology, tourism, innovation and education, medicine, youth and other areas.\nThe active involvement of experts and scientists, public and private sector representatives in their activities shall undoubtedly have a great effect.\nMoreover, time demands a dramatic increase in the role and influence of the Secretariat of our Organization.\nIt should effectively organize work in all directions, become an influential power of our fruitful multilateral cooperation.\nBased on the above, I believe that we shall approve the new structure of the Secretariat at our next Summit.\nAnother issue is related to the strengthening of the strict monitoring system of implementation of all decisions and documents adopted by the Heads of States.\nI believe we should involve that the council of elders of our Organization into this process and use their rich experience and skills.\nDear friends!\nOur Turkic world has an enviable great history, great ancestors and incomparable wealth.\nAnd I believe that the Turkic world has a great future.\nNo doubt, we shall create this future together with our hardworking, magnanimous and noble people.\nOur Summit in the ancient city of Samarkand shall usher in a new stage of growth in the modern history of civilization of the Turkic world.\nToday, the Samarkand Declaration, which expresses such a noble idea, shall be adopted.\nI would like to thank you for your support of our proposal to declare 2023 as the Year of the Rise of Turkic Civilization within our Organization.\nDear colleagues!\nTaking this opportunity, on behalf of all my colleagues I would like to wish to the President of Kazakhstan esteemed Kassym-Jomart Kemelevich Tokayev and the friendly people of Kazakhstan successful holding of the important political event \u2013 the forthcoming presidential elections.\nWe believe that wise people of Kazakhstan will vote for the peace and progress of their country, continuity of the important reforms that are being carried out.\nIn conclusion, I would like to pay a special tribute to Mr. Baghdad Amreyev, who is completing his service as Secretary-General of our Organization.\nI wish You success and good luck in Your future endeavours.\nI also warmly congratulate the newly appointed Secretary-General Mr. Kuvanichbek Omuraliev, who is an experienced diplomat.\nI wish You a great success in Your responsible work.\nThank you for your attention!\n\nSource:\n\nPress Service of JSC \u201cNational Electric Grid of Uzbekistan\u201d\n", "creation_date": "11.11.2022", "access_date": "2024-03-10 00:15:58"},

It is the time demand.\nIn this process, the \u00abVoice of Global South\u00bbmust be taken into account - the necessary conditions must be created to untap the potential of the developing countries.\nUnfortunately, our countries still face various difficulties and restrictions in entering the major markets.\nConsidering our countries\u2019 industrial and agricultural potential, as well as their large domestic markets, it is important to develop common approaches on creating a fair competitive environment at the global level.\nAlong with this, we believe that the agenda of the World Summit should include issues of ensuring the energy and food security of the developing countries, creating global logistics and value chains, assistance in attracting investment and modern technologies.\nAnother strategic issue.We fully support the development of the \u201cNORTH-SOUTH\u201d international corridor, which is one of the main TRANSPORT ARTERIES in the Eurasian region.\nWe are actively promoting a project of the construction of a railway through Afghanistan to the Indian Ocean aimed at strengthening the connectivity of Central and South Asia.\nWe invite our partners to participate in the implementation of this very important project.\nThe analysis shows that the huge technological gap between the developed and developing countries is growing during the transition to the \u201cGreen Economy\u201d.\nWe consider it is high time to create a \u201cgreen technology and innovation database\u201d for the Global South with the support of the world's leading countries.\nThe next urgent issue is the development of human capital and the improvement of the quality of professional education. We are interested in intensifying our cooperation with India in education.\nDear colleagues!\nIn the context of \u201cHuman-Centric Development\u201d, the issue of educating the young generation must occupy the main place.\nWe must widely involve our talented youth in the development of national and international programs in climate change, rational use of water resources, alternative energy, digitalization and other priority areas.\nIn this regard, I would like to suggest the establishment of a platform for dialogue of our countries \u201cVoice of the Youth\u201d.\nDear colleagues!\nThe negative consequences of the various escalating clashes in the world today are felt primarily in the developing countries.\nI am confident that during the G20 chairmanship of India, which was described by my dear brother Narendra Modi as \u201cthe land of Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi\u201d, the new proposals and ideas for peace and security on a global scale will be presented to the world community.\nI am convinced that you will support the proposal of forming an international dialogue group to address the problem of Afghanistan, which Uzbekistan is also promoting in this direction.\nDear friends!\nWe always support India\u2019s active efforts to protect the interests of developing countries at the international level.\nUndoubtedly, all proposals and initiatives expressed today will serve people\u2019s interests and the goals of sustainable development.\nTaking this opportunity, I would like to sincerely congratulate the brotherly people of India on the country\u2019s upcoming National holiday \u2013the Republic Day.\nThank you for your attention.\n\nSource:\n\n\nPress Service of JSC \u201cNational Electric Grid of Uzbekistan\u201d", "creation_date": "12.01.2023", "access_date": "2024-03-10 00:15:59"},

Shavkat Mirziyoyev\nto the participants of the Second Tashkent International Investment Forum\n\nDear participants of the Forum!\nDear guests, ladies and gentlemen!\nI am very pleased to welcome you at the Second Tashkent International Investment Forum.\nIn fact, our meetings as part of this forum with the representatives of foreign governments and international financial institutions and heads of high-profile companies, who are close friends and reliable partners of Uzbekistan, are becoming a good tradition for all of us.\nWe perceive your visit to our hospitable land as a show of respect for our country and trust in our reforms. Welcome to Uzbekistan!\nDear participants of the Forum!\nIt is no secret that complicated and dangerous processes and unpredictable changes taking place on the international arena pose a serious challenge to the world economy.\nI am confident that our meeting today in such a contradictory environment shall:\n- promote bilateral and multilateral cooperation,\n- open new business opportunities for all of us.\nDear friends!\nAt the First International Investment Forum last year, new areas of cooperation were discussed and many agreements were reached.\nWithin a year, we have intensively continued systemic reforms to further liberalize our country's economy, open a wide path for businesses, and strengthen the rule of law and legal guarantees.\n1.\u00a0Notably, we have made great transformations in creating the most favourable fiscal system in our region.\nIn particular, the value added tax rate has been reduced to 12 percent. As you know, previously this rate stood at 20 percent.\nEntrepreneurs also welcome that:\n-\u00a07 days VAT refund system has been introduced for exporters;\n-\u00a0and the mutual accounting has been established in the tax and customs services. Until now, investors were stranded between two separate systems.\nIn addition:\n- the dividends received from shares of foreign investors were exempted from taxation for a period of three years;\n- and the actual profit tax for them was reduced from 20 to 12 percent.\nImportantly, it has been strictly specified that no new or aggravating liability measures can be introduced into tax and customs legislation.\n2.\u00a0The following important steps have been taken to liberalize foreign trade.\nCustoms duties have been abolished on more than 7 thousand types of raw materials and goods needed by investors.\nA simplified processing procedure has been introduced in the customs territory.\nIn order to bring the foreign trade and competitive environment to a new level, and gain access to new markets, we have intensified our efforts in acceding the World Trade Organization.\nI would like to emphasize that WTO requirements are fully coherent with the objectives of our reforms and we are interested in becoming a member of this prestigious organization as soon as possible.\nThe negotiations with the WTO member-states and harmonization of national legislation with its rules are now in full swing.\nWe have set specific objectives to achieve significant results by the end of the year.\n3.\u00a0We have embarked on an ambitious administrative reform to reduce bureaucracy, eliminate corruption and introduce compact, efficient management in the executive branch of power.\nIn this regard, all ministries were reformed, their number was reduced from 61 to 28, and their responsibilities and powers were clearly defined.\nIn addition, 500 functions of the state in business regulation were abolished, \u00a0and 70 were transferred to the private sector on the basis of public-private partnership and outsourcing.\nSo far, 132 licenses and permits have been withdrawn, and notification procedures have been introduced for 33 of them.\nMost importantly, an integrated investor engagement system has been introduced as part of the reform.\nThe Ministry of Investment, Industry and Trade has set up a \u201cSingle Window\u201d to assist investors in all processes from project initiation to its launch.\nThe Foreign Investors\u2019 Council under the President began its work to promptly address investors\u2019 issues and establish direct communication with the Head of State.\nI am keen to communicate more with foreign companies and business persons. Your ideas, proposals and initiatives give me strength and encourage me to new reforms.\nTherefore, I am ready to hold frequent meetings with new investors and personally guarantee you success in our country.\n4.\u00a0We are dynamically continuing our reforms in terms of reliable protection of the rights of investors.\nWe have greatly simplified the conditions for foreign investors to buy real estate, enter and leave Uzbekistan, as well as residence permit procedures.\nSignificant steps are being made in terms of guaranteed judicial protection of investors\u2019 rights.\nIn this regard, the competencies of administrative courts were increased and they were given significant powers.\nFrom now on, entrepreneurs and investors do not need to prove their claim in court. Now, the state agency will need to prove the legality of its decision.\nAny arising uncertainties will be resolved in favor of investors.\nWe have set the mechanisms for enforcing the decisions of international arbitration courts in our legislation.\nWe will continue our reforms in protecting the rights of entrepreneurs this yeats as well.\nIn particular, the International Commercial Court will start its activities for the first time in our history. It has become possible thanks to the support of international experts.\n5. As a result of our reforms, Uzbekistan\u2019s status of a country with the most diversified economy in the region will further strengthen.\nIn one year alone, the following has been accomplished:\n- nearly 100 thousand new enterprises created;\n- the annual volume of attracted foreign investments reached $10 billion, in other words, it has tripled against 2017, when we began the reforms;\n- nearly 1 million people have been lifted out of poverty, and the poverty rate has dropped from 17 to 14 percent. I would like to point out that this rate was over 30 percent when the reforms began.\nIndeed, you, our partners, play an invaluable role in these achievements.\nIn recent years, with your support we established thousands of modern enterprises, implemented major projects, and created hundreds of thousands new high-paying jobs.\nTaking this opportunity, I would like to extend my deep gratitude and sincere respect to all foreign and domestic investors, governments of our partner states and international financial institutions that have been making a worthy contribution to these achievements.\nDear guests!\nWe need even stronger legal framework in order for our reforms to progress rapidly and for businesses to develop safely and freely in our country.\nAs you know, in the coming days a nationwide referendum will take place on the renewed Constitution of the New Uzbekistan.\nFirst and foremost, our new Constitution specifically states Uzbekistan as a sovereign, democratic, law-governed, social, and civil state.\nAll changes are based on the idea that \u201chuman rights and freedoms are the paramount priority\u201d.\nIn addition, for the first time in our Constitution the state assumes obligations regarding:\n- assuring a comfortable investment and business environment,\n- ensuring inviolability of property,\n- developing market relations and creating conditions for fair competition;\n- ensuring the independence of courts.\nThere is no doubt that the New Constitution will continue the reforms we have launched, and most importantly, it will make them irreversible.\nDear friends!\nNow, I would like to dwell on new opportunities in enhancing cooperation with you.\nFirst, Uzbekistan will firmly continue its path toward green transition.\nIn particular, the world\u2019s most prestigious companies, such as ACWA Power, Masdar, TOTAL Eren, are implementing large-scale solar and wind power plant projects in our country.\nThis year alone more than 2 thousand megawatts of capacity will be commissioned, and next year -\u00a0 it will reach 8 thousand megawatts.\n\"Green economy\u201d is inviting new industrial sectors to our country.\nEnterprises producing solar panels, wind turbines, inverters and other electrical engineering products are being established.\nThis means \u00a08 billion US dollars worth of opportunities for investors.\nWe are inviting you to implement these projects, and are ready to create all the necessary conditions for this.\nSecond, until recently, important sectors of the economy consisted only of state-owned enterprises.\nAs a result of these reforms, private investments are actively flowing into previously \"closed\" industries.\nHere is an example. A wide path has opened for the private sector in aviation, which used to be a 100% state-owned network.\nIn particular, by setting up five private airlines and inviting an external operator company to the Samarkand airport enabled us to increase the number of flights by 2.5 times.\nWe will continue reforms aimed at creating a competitive environment in the transport sector.\nThis year, we will transfer the management of Andijan, Namangan, Bukhara and Urgench airports to the private sector.\nWe are also initiating big changes in the railway sector, and I kindly invite investors to take an active part in this process.\nAt the same time, the fact that Uzbekistan is becoming a \"regional hub\" in the rapidly growing fields of IT, tourism, education, and healthcare is a great opportunity in this direction.\nWe shall rely on the support of international financial institutions in the implementation these plans.\nFor instance, the Islamic Development Bank has trusted us and is actively working on 1.5 billion US dollars worth public-private partnership projects without state guarantees.\nIn this regard, I express my special gratitude to the President of the Bank, Mr. Muhammad Sulaiman Al Jasser, who is with us today in this forum.\nI think our cooperation will be long-standing and be beneficial to both parties.\nIn general, this year, 14 billion US dollars worth dedicated programs in the field of public-private partnership have been developed with the support of international financial institutions.\nThe cover such important areas for state as transport, utilities and water management, public health and specific projects will be presented to you during this forum.\nThird, we adopted a \"one thousand, one thousand, forty\" program to privatize state assets.\nThis means that:\n- one thousand enterprises with a state share and one thousand properties owned by the state will be put up for public auction;\n- 40 enterprises of strategic importance for our economy will hold an IPO.\nIn particular, shares of large gold and copper producing enterprises, telecommunication and insurance companies, as well as banks will be offered to investors.\nFourth, we attach priority to elevating industrial development to a new level.\nFor instance, today textile, leather and footwear, construction materials, electrical, mechanical engineering industries have a sufficient base of raw materials and qualified personnel.\nIn other words, there are enough capacities to make a \"big leap\" in these areas and increase the volume of their production and exports by 2 times.\nIn this regard, we need to cooperate with major brands, gain access to foreign markets, innovations and modern technologies.\nWe are ready to create all the conditions, organize dedicated technological parks and industrial zones and provide other additional benefits for the relevant investors.\nI have instructed the ministers in this regard. They will present to you 160 large and mutually beneficial projects during the Forum sessions.\nFifth, we continue our policy of good neighborliness in Central Asia and are actively working with neighboring states to further promote economic cooperation.\nTo this end, we organize joint investment funds and carry out major regional projects in the fields of industry, energy, transport and water management.\nBased on the principle of \"complementarity\" of our economies, we will resolutely continue industrial and agricultural cooperation.\nI am pleased to welcome the Head of Government of the neighboring Kyrgyz Republic Mr. Oqilbek Japarov at the Forum.\nThrough cooperation with brotherly Kyrgyz Republic, in recent years the volume of mutual trade has increased 5 times, and the number of joint ventures has grown\n8 times.\nIn particular, we have launched large-scale joint projects in textiles, automobile production, geology, chemical industry, agriculture and water management, animal husbandry.\nAll of these projects are financed through the Uzbekistan-Kyrgyzstan Development Fund established in 2021.\nIntensive work is underway on such projects as the construction of \u201cKambarata HPP-1\u201d and the \u201cChina-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan\u201d railway.\nIn this regard, I would like to express special gratitude to the representatives of governments of neighboring countries, heads of major companies and entrepreneurs, who are actively supporting these initiatives aimed at enhancing cooperation between countries of our region.\nDear participants of the event!\nWe highly appreciate your attendance in today's forum and your interest in doing business in our country.\nThere is no doubt that today's forum will open new opportunities for all of us.\nI am confident that during your interactions you will discover unique business opportunities in the New Uzbekistan.\nIn our country you will find the desired peace and stability, a favorable investment environment and necessary guarantees. I guarantee it to you as President.\nI am confident that the New Uzbekistan will be a place that will leave a bright mark on your business activities.\nMay success and profound victories accompany you all in your future endeavors!\nDuring the forum I wish you to achieve mutually beneficial agreements!\nThank you for your attention!\nSource:\n\n\nPress Service of JSC \u201cNational Electric Grid of Uzbekistan\u201d", "creation_date": "27.04.2023", "access_date": "2024-03-10 00:15:59"},

{"url": "https://www.uzbekistonmet.uz/en/lists/view/2719", "title": "Article by the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev \"The SCO Samarkand Summit: Dialogue and Cooperation in an Interconnected World\"", "text": "\nUzbekistan\u2019s chairmanship in the SCO has fallen on a dynamic period, fraught with various events and trends \u2013 the period of the \u00abhistorical rift\u00bb, when one era comes to an end and another begins \u2013 thus far unpredictable and unknown.\nThe modern system of international cooperation, based on the universal principles and norms, begins to falter. One of the main reasons for this is a deep crisis of trust at the global level, which, in turn, provokes a geopolitical confrontation and the risk of reviving the bloc thinking stereotypes. This process of mutual alienation complicates the return of the world economy to its former course of development and the restoration of global supply chains.\nThe ongoing armed conflicts in different parts of the world destabilize trade and investment flows, exacerbate the problems of ensuring food and energy security.\nAlong with this, global climate shocks, growing scarcity of natural and water resources, decline in biodiversity, spread of dangerous infectious diseases have exposed the vulnerability of our societies as never before. They lead to destruction of existential common goods, threatening the basis of people\u2019s life and reducing sources of income.\nIn these circumstances, it is obvious that no country alone can hope to avoid or cope with these global risks and challenges.\nThere is only one way out of the dangerous spiral of problems in an interconnected world where we all live today - through a constructive dialogue and multilateral cooperation based on consideration and respect to the interests of everyone. It is exactly at the time of crisis, when all the countries \u2013 whether they are large, medium or small by size \u2013 must put aside their narrow interests and focus on such mutual interaction, unite and multiply the common efforts and possibilities to counter the threats and challenges to peace, security and sustainable development that are related to each of us.\nThe effective international cooperation makes the world more stable, predictable and prosperous. This is the most viable, accessible and closest way to solving common problems of our time as well as a universal insurance policy against the future challenges and shocks.\n\nA Model for Successful Regional Cooperation\nThe international cooperation that lays in the interest of everyone is impossible without multilateral institutions. Despite the certain shortcomings, they continue to serve as the most important agents of interaction between the countries - at the regional and global levels. The international and regional organizations help countries to overcome the differences and strengthen mutual understanding, to develop political and economic cooperation, to expand trade and stimulate cultural and humanitarian exchanges.\nThese are the goals and objectives that are pursued by one of the youngest multilateral institutions - the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). In fact, it is a unique interstate structure that has managed to unite countries\nwith different cultural and civilizational codes, their own foreign policy guidelines and models of national development. In a relatively short historical period, the SCO has come a long way, becoming an integral element of the modern global political and economic world order.\nToday, the SCO family is the world\u2019s largest regional organization, which has united a huge geographical space and about a half of the population of our planet.\nThe basis for the SCO\u2019s international attractiveness is its non-bloc status, openness, non-targeting against third countries or the international organizations, equality and respect for the sovereignty of all participants, refusal to interfere in the internal affairs, as well as prevention of political confrontation and unhealthy rivalry.\nThe SCO\u2019s success concept is the promotion of multifaceted cooperation through ensuring regional security.\nIn fact, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization is called upon to become a pole of attraction without dividing lines, in the name of peace, cooperation and progress.\nTherefore, the number of states that are ready to cooperate with the SCO is growing every year, and \u00a0this is especially noticeable in the context of the transformation of the modern system of international and regional relations.\nThe economic value of the SCO is enhanced by the self-sufficiency of its space, where there are dynamically developing economies of the world with huge human, intellectual and technological potential, and the existence of large volumes of unused natural resources.\nToday, the total GDP of the SCO member states has reached about a quarter of the global figure. This is already a very solid contribution to the global sustainable development from a regional organization that has just crossed its 20-year threshold.\nIn a world with the new challenges and opportunities, the SCO has excellent prospects for transformation and growth, not only through quantitative replenishment, but also through the opening of new strategic vectors. These are transport and connectivity, energy, food and environmental security, innovations, digital transformation and green economy.\n\nUzbekistan\u2019s Chairmanship: towards Common Success through Joint Development\nAccepting responsible mission of Chairmanship in the SCO, the Republic of Uzbekistan has relied on the strategy of advancing the development of the Organization by opening up new horizons for cooperation and launching usage of untapped reserves that each of its members has.\nOur slogan is\n\u00abThe SCO is strong if each of us is strong\u00bb\n. Implementing this, we have made serious efforts to make the Organization even stronger from the inside and more attractive from the outside to our international partners.\nAt the platforms of more than eighty major events held during the year, a comprehensive agenda was formed for the SCO \u2013 starting from the issues of further expanding cooperation in the security, strengthening transport and economic connectivity and positioning the Organization in the international arena up to the search for new ways and points for development.\nAll these promising directions of cooperation for the SCO at the new stage of its historical development are reflected in more than thirty conceptual programs, agreements and decisions prepared during our chairmanship period.\nI would say even more. Uzbekistan\u2019s chairmanship in the SCO is a logical continuation of an active and open foreign policy course that has been pursued by our country in the last six years. This policy is embodied, above all, in Central Asia, the geographical core of SCO, where positive and irreversible processes of strengthening good-neighborliness and cooperation are now taking place.\nAll SCO member states are our closest neighbors, friends and strategic partners.\nThe Chairmanship has given us a good opportunity to further strengthen multilateral collaboration and expand bilateral cooperation with each of them, as well as set new targets for even deeper partnership.\nI am full of confidence that it is important and necessary for the SCO to share its success story with Afghanistan. This country is an integral part of the larger SCO space. The Afghan people need good neighbors and their support now more than ever. It is our moral obligation to extend a helping hand, to offer them effective ways of overcoming the years-long crisis by promoting socio-economic growth of the country, its integration into regional and global development processes.\nAfghanistan that has played for centuries the role of a buffer in the historical confrontations of global and regional powers, should try on a new peaceful mission of connecting Central and South Asia.\nThe construction of the trans-Afghan corridor could become a symbol of such mutually beneficial inter-regional cooperation. It is also important to understand that by implementing joint infrastructure projects such as the Termez\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Mazar-i-Sharif\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Kabul\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Peshawar railroad we are not just solving socio-economic, transport and communication problems, but also making a significant contribution to ensuring regional security.\nBy bringing our positions closer to each other, together we can develop a new SCO agenda for a more peaceful, stable and prosperous Afghanistan. Only in this way can we create a truly stable and sustainable SCO space with an indivisible security.\n\n\u00abSamarkand Spirit\u00bb - the Embodiment of Cooperation, Mutual Understanding and Friendship\nAfter a three-year pandemic pause that has caused serious disruption in trade, economic and industrial ties, the countries and peoples of the SCO need to communicate directly.\nThe ancient city of Samarkand, the jewel of the Great Silk Road, is ready to welcome the leaders of fourteen countries with new breakthrough proposals and initiatives designed to serve for good and prosperity of the SCO and each of its members.\nThere is no doubt that this legendary city will open another chapter of the SCO success story. Glorious historical heritage of Samarkand will contribute to this.\nFor many centuries, this city has been threading together countries from Europe to China, merging North and South, East and West into a single node.\nHistorically Samarkand has been a melting pot of ideas and knowledge, that was \u201ccooking\u201d a common goal of living better, being more successful and becoming happier. And everybody has known that the friendly neighbors are half of your wealth, you yourself are a blessing for them, because you know that cooperation, trade, oeuvre, science, art and the best ideas do good, enrich and bring nations together.\nThese unique qualities of Samarkand, which today has a modern and dynamically developing infrastructure, turning it into the most suitable and demanded platform for joint discussions, searching for necessary responses to regional and global challenges.\nThe integrity and interconnectivity of mankind are such that most challenges require joint work not only at the regional level, but also at the global arena.\nRelying on the experience of our many years of joint work, we are confident that the Samarkand SCO summit will set an example of how we can launch a new, inclusive dialogue based on the principles of mutual respect, trust and constructive cooperation\nfor the sake of common security and prosperity.\nSamarkand can become the platform that can unite and reconcile states with different foreign policy priorities.\nHistorically, the world looked upon from Samarkand has been seen as single and indivisible, rather than fragmented. This is indeed the essence of the unique phenomenon of the \u00abSamarkand spirit\u00bb, which can serve as the basis for a fundamentally new format of international interaction, including within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.\nThe \u00abSamarkand spirit\u00bb is designed to naturally complement the very \u00abShanghai spirit\u00bb, thanks to which more than 20 years ago our countries decided to create a new and eagerly sought organization.\nTherefore, we are confident that in Samarkand we shall witness the birth of a new stage in the life of SCO \u2013 the number of its members will grow, and its future agenda will be formed, and this is highly symbolic.\nWe are full of optimism and are convinced that the decisions of the upcoming summit of Shanghai Cooperation Organization will make a feasible contribution to strengthening the dialogue, mutual understanding and cooperation both at the regional level and on a global scale.\n\nShavkat Mirziyoyev\nPresident of the Republic of Uzbekistan\n\n\nInformation service of JSC \u00abNEG of Uzbekistan\u00bb\n", "creation_date": "12.09.2022", "access_date": "2024-03-10 00:16:02"},

Despite the consequences of the pandemic and global upheavals, together we have managed to fully implement the Chairmanship Plan. More than 80 major events have been held. Our joint efforts are reflected in more than 40 documents, which will be adopted today.\nOnce again, I express gratitude to all the SCO States, as well as the Organization\u2019s Secretariat and the Executive Committee of the Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure for their active assistance to our chairmanship.\nDear participants of the summit!\nAs the world faces a deficit of trust and mutual understanding, confrontations and conflicts have intensified numerous challenges to stability and security.\nThe following problems of our time pose the serious risks to sustainable development: climate change, lack of water and natural resources, social and economic consequences of the pandemic, energy and food security crisis.\nThe global demand for mutual trust, justice and solidarity is growing. In this regard, it is needed to continue an open and constructive dialogue more than ever. The activity of our Organization demonstrates to the world that such a dialogue is possible.\nThanks to its firm commitment to the principles of openness and non-alignment, the SCO strengthens mutually beneficial relations among the participating countries and successfully deepens the international cooperation. The SCO membership is expanding,\nas well as our partnership is developing.\nA Memorandum of Obligations of the Islamic Republic of Iran as a full member of the Organization is being signed today. I sincerely congratulate the President of Iran, Mr. Ebrahim Raisi and all our colleagues on this historic event.\nWe welcome the signing of memorandums on granting the status of dialogue partners to the Arab Republic of Egypt and the State of Qatar.\nIn addition, we are making the decisions to start procedures to grant the Republic of Belarus the status of a full member of the SCO, and the Kingdom of Bahrain, the State of Kuwait, the Republic of Maldives, the United Arab Emirates and the Republic of the Union of Myanmar \u2013 as dialogue partners.\nThe expansion of the geographical coverage of the SCO is another confirmation of the importance of our Organization, which demonstrates efficiency, mutual understanding and dynamism.\nDistinguished Heads of delegations!\nThe SCO is entering a new, even more responsible stage of its development. We should solve many priority tasks of cooperation together.\nIn our opinion, first of all, it is important to continue to maintain the non-aligned status of the Organization and its openness.\nWe firmly adhere to the principle of the indivisibility of security. The SCO\u2019s activities should continue to be focused on broad partnership. We are also convinced that Central Asia should retain its status as the \u00abgeographical core\u00bb of the SCO.\nAnother key objective is to strengthen cohesion, mutual support and partnership based on the principles of \u00abShanghai spirit\u00bb. Only in this way we can ensure peace, stability and prosperity in the SCO region.\nI believe that, based on these principled approaches and taking into account the international situation, we can start preparing the SCO Development Strategy until 2040. This document should cover all areas of our multifaceted cooperation and determine\nthe priorities for the long-term development of the SCO.\nFirst of all, it is extremely important to improve the practical impact of cooperation in the fields of economy, trade and investment. This is one of the key conditions for ensuring stability in the region and improving the well-being of the population of our countries.\nIt is obvious that it is necessary to use the reliable models of regional interaction to achieve greater economic sustainability. It is important to move on to real actions to build the production chains among the SCO countries with a shorter \u00absupply shoulder\u00bb.\nWe are interested in maximizing the existing potential, taking into account the advantages of the complementarity of the economies of the SCO countries. In this regard, we propose to start forming a common space for industrial and technological cooperation\nby launching a New SCO Economic Dialogue.\nIts main task is to combine opportunities and activate all the mechanisms of trade and economic cooperation that we have created by eliminating trade and customs barriers, forming guaranteed and stable production and supply chains, stimulating joint programs on localization and import substitution, as well as by protecting and promoting mutual investments, primarily in the development of infrastructure, competitive industry and the services sector.\nIn order to ensure full-scale economic cooperation among our countries and get the concrete results of practical cooperation, we propose holding the Week of Business Partnership of the SCO regions in Uzbekistan.\nFor the purpose of deepening the industrial cooperation and stimulate trade, we also advocate creating an Alliance of the SCO Special Economic Zones. We are ready to hold the first meeting of heads of administrations of special zones next year, here\nin Samarkand, in the premises of the \u201cUzbekistan\u2013SCO\u201d Industrial Zone.\nAs another measure, we propose holding a Grand SCO Trade Fair on an annual basis, with launching a single electronic platform on its basis.\nThis will also be facilitated by the Joint Action Plan for the Development of Intraregional Trade that we are adopting today.\nI would like to draw your attention to one more important question.\nWe should admit that despite the fact that our countries are major producers, exporters and importers of agricultural and food products, we have not yet been able to establish serious cooperation on food security issues at the SCO platform.\nThe potential of our states allows us to consistently provide the domestic markets with grain crops, livestock, fruit and vegetables, basic foodstuffs, as well as the necessary fertilizers. In addition, we must contribute to solving this issue at the global level.\nIn this regard, we consider it necessary to develop General Principles and Approaches to Food Security. It is important to provide the specific measures in this document to bring the regulatory framework, to conduct the joint research and to introduce innovations.\nIn addition, the most serious attention should be paid to programs for cultivation and processing agricultural crops, formation of coordinated schemes of direct mutual deliveries, organization of efficient logistics, \u00abgreen\u00bb and express corridors for the delivery of high-quality and affordable food products.\nIn order to widely discuss these vital issues, we propose to hold the International Conference on Food Security next year.\nDear colleagues!\nToday we are adopting the SCO Concept for strengthening Connectivity and Establishing Effective Transport Corridors.\nIn order to practically implement the main provisions of the Concept, we propose to establish an Interregional Center for Connectivity in the city of Tashkent, with the support of the United Nations.\nWe also consider signing of the trilateral Agreement on the construction of the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway as a historic event as a part of the summit.\nWe urge you to support another strategically important project \u2013 the construction of the Termez-Mazar-i-Sharif-Kabul-Peshawar railway corridor.\nImplementation of these two projects shall open up the broad opportunities for strengthening the connectivity, increasing the mutual trade and investment, and, in general, ensuring the sustainable economic growth in the space of our Organization.\nWe could discuss all promising projects in the field of transport and communications at the site of the first SCO Transport Forum next year in Uzbekistan.\nThe issues of the environmental agenda are particularly urgent.\nToday, by adopting the joint Statement on Response to Climate Change, the SCO demonstrates solidarity in confronting these risks and challenges.\nAt the same time, we need the new mechanisms and formats for practical cooperation in this area, which is vital for all of us.\nWe propose creating an SCO Climate Council that would bring together our politicians and public figures, scientists and environmental experts, as well as the business representatives.\nThis format shall increase the effectiveness of cooperation in promoting the climate adaptation projects, combating desertification and land degradation, as well as introducing water\u2013 saving technologies.\nIt is especially in needed in the context of overcoming the devastating consequences of the Aral Sea ecological catastrophe.\nAn important condition for the development of the SCO is effective cooperation in the security. In the new realities it is urgent to strengthen the coordination of the activities of law enforcement agencies and special services of our countries.\nThe issue of increasing the effectiveness of the SCO Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure on the basis of our agreements to improve its activities, including in matters of prevention and prompt response to security challenges and threats, has long been overdue.\nIt is important to establish the practice of annual field meetings of the Council of the SCO RATS to assess the situation in our countries and make the comprehensive decisions, taking into account today\u2019s realities.\nThe growth of radicalism is becoming a dangerous trend.\nWe consider it expedient to take a set of effective measures to prevent the involvement of youth in the extremist organizations, to form a stable immunity to various destructive ideologies.\nI would also like to draw your attention to the development of secure information and communication technologies, which already largely determine modern life.\nOnly by joining forces will we be able to take full advantage of digitalization, while reducing threats in the information space.\nThe task of creating a joint platform for combating cybercrime is becoming increasingly urgent.\nStrengthening the coordination in promoting peace and the socio-economic reconstruction of Afghanistan should remain among the SCO\u2019s key priorities.\nI would like to especially thank my colleagues for their support of the recent Tashkent conference.\nThe participation of the Afghan delegation, the representatives of many states and international organizations, including the SCO, confirms the desire of the world community to develop coordinated approaches to cooperation with this country.\nLet me stress that the Afghan people need our good-neighborly help more than ever. We must not repeat the mistakes of the past by leaving Afghanistan alone with its problems.\nThe tightening of sanctions and the further isolation of the current Afghan authorities will inevitably lead to increased radicalization within the country and its transformation into a springboard for the terrorist organizations.\nIn this regard, we stand for the development of constructive contacts with Kabul to fulfill the international obligations previously adopted by Afghanistan\u2019s Interim Authorities, including in the field of women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights.\nIn addition, we propose to jointly create a special Humanitarian Support Fund for Afghanistan in our border city of Termez, making use of the modern infrastructure of the international transport and logistics hub established there.\nThe funds shall be used to overcome the social crisis in this country, to implement the educational programs for youth and the projects in healthcare.\nDistinguished summit participants!\nCultural and humanitarian ties traditionally form a solid foundation for our cooperation. Strong friendship and mutual understanding among our peoples are the key to peace and broad partnership in the SCO region.\nThe Comprehensive Plan for the Implementation of the Treaty on Long-term Good Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation, which is being adopted today, is aimed precisely at these goals.\nBased on the principle of respect for the diversity of cultures, our Organization opens up the new opportunities for intercultural communication and exchange to the millions of people.\nI believe it necessary to establish the additional formats as a part of the SCO, such as the Forum of University Rectors, the Days of Culture and Tourism, joint sports events and Universiade.\nI would like to note that the modern technologies also allow us to launch digital platforms for intercultural dialogue.

Over the centuries a special culture of fruitful communication between the representatives of different civilizations has been created here.\nSamarkand is a living example of how the principles of tolerance and respect for the traditions and the values of different peoples, which we took as a basis when creating the SCO, have been put into practice for centuries.\nNow such a dialogue, free from geopolitical rivalry, ideological contradictions and disputes, is extremely in demand.\nTherefore, today Uzbekistan is pleased to offer the Samarkand Solidarity Initiative for Common Security and Prosperity to the partners.\nIts goal is to involve in the global inter-civilizational dialogue all those who care about our common future, who are ready, regardless of differences, to seek agreed approaches and solutions, who share the principles of the \u00abSamarkand spirit\u00bb.\nWe propose to jointly consider the issues of practical implementation of this initiative at the international Samarkand forum next year with the participation of political leaders, the authoritative public figures, business, academic and expert circles.\nThe Forum\u2019s work shall be based on rich Program of Action, which we will soon present to all our partners.

DiCarlo, the SCO Secretary-General Zhang Ming and the Director of the SCO RATS Executive Committee Ruslan Mirzayev also attended the summit.\nUzbekistan is as one of the founding countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and plays an important and active role in its activities. The Uzbekistan\u2019s initiatives have always contributed to increasing the potential and international authority of the SCO, as well as strengthening the multilateral interaction.\nThe Uzbekistan\u2019s chairmanship in the SCO in 2021-2022 is distinguished by its dynamics, content, richness and focus on the results. As the President of Uzbekistan noted that despite the consequences of the pandemic and global upheavals, we have managed to fully implement the Chairmanship Plan together.\nMore than 80 major events have been held. Several new formats and mechanisms of cooperation within the SCO have been launched in such areas as information and communication technologies, food security and poverty reduction.\nThe forums, conferences and other events were held on the current issues in the economy, industry, innovation, tourism, healthcare, public diplomacy, promotion of the gender agenda and women\u2019s entrepreneurship. As a result, a solid foundation has been laid for a significant expansion of the Organization\u2019s activities.\nThe President of the Republic of Uzbekistan noted in his speech that \u00abin the light of the events taking place around us, today\u2019s summit has a special, historical significance\u00bb. \u00abThe SCO is entering a new, even more responsible stage of its development. The Organization will have to\u00a0solve many priority tasks of cooperation.\nThe Leader of Uzbekistan put forward several concrete proposals and practical initiatives on the current issues of multifaceted cooperation within the SCO.\nFirst of all, it is important to continue to maintain the non-aligned status of the SCO and its openness,\u00a0adhering to the principle of the indivisibility of security. The SCO\u2019s activities should continue to be focused on broad partnership. It is also important that Central Asia should retain its status as the \u00abgeographical core\u00bb of the SCO.\n\u00abAnother key objective is to strengthen cohesion, mutual support and partnership based on the principles of the \u00abShanghai Spirit\u00bb. Only in this way we can ensure peace, stability and prosperity in the SCO region\u00bb, the President of Uzbekistan noted.\nIn this regard,\u00a0based on these principled approaches and taking into account the international situation, we can start preparing the SCO Development Strategy until 2040.\u00a0This document should cover all areas of our multifaceted cooperation and determine the priorities for the long-term development of the SCO.\nIt is extremely important to improve the practical impact of cooperation in the fields of economy, trade and investment.\u00a0In this regard, we propose to start forming a common space for industrial and technological cooperation by launching a New SCO Economic Dialogue,\u00a0holding the Week of Business Partnership of the SCO regions in Uzbekistan,\u00a0creating an Alliance of the SCO Special Economic Zones,\u00a0holding a Grand SCO Trade Fair on an annual basis,\u00a0with launching a single electronic platform on its basis.\nThe food crisis in the world dictates the need for active cooperation within the SCO. With this in mind, the President of Uzbekistan proposed to develop General Principles and Approaches to Food Security.\nThe document aims to promote the harmonization of the regulatory framework to ensure the freedom of movement of goods and services, a single digital labeling of goods and customs procedures to prevent food shortages and ensure complementarity.\nIn addition, it is proposed to hold the SCO International Conference on Food Security in Uzbekistan next year.\nStressing the need for strengthening transport connectivity in the SCO space, the President of Uzbekistan put forward an initiative to create an Interregional Center for Connectivity in the city of Tashkent, with the support of the United Nations.\nDescribing the signing of the trilateral Agreement on the construction of the China \u2013 Kyrgyzstan \u2013 Uzbekistan railway as a historic event at the summit, the Leader of Uzbekistan called for supporting another strategically important project \u2013 the construction of the Termez \u2013 Mazar-i-Sharif \u2013 Kabul \u2013 Peshawar railway corridor.\n\u00abImplementation of these two projects shall open up the broad opportunities for strengthening connectivity, increasing the mutual trade and investment, and, in general, ensuring the sustainable economic growth in the space of our Organization\u00bb, Shavkat Mirziyoyev stressed.\u00a0We could discuss all promising projects in the field of transport and communications at the site of the first SCO Transport Forum next year in Uzbekistan and jointly develop a Joint Action Plan based on its results.\nFocusing on the growing environmental challenges and threats, the Head of the state put forward the initiative to create the SCO Climate Council. This mechanism is designed to strengthen cooperation in the field of green development, combating desertification and land degradation, attracting innovative solutions and financial resources for the implementation of projects, including in the Aral Sea region.\nA special attention was paid to the cooperation in security. Strengthening the coordination of the activities of law enforcement agencies and special services, increasing the effectiveness of the SCO RATS, including in matters of prevention and rapid response to security challenges and threats, were noted among the priorities in the speech of the President of Uzbekistan.\nAt the same time, it was proposed to take a set of effective measures to prevent the involvement of youth in extremist organizations, the form a stable immunity to various destructive ideologies.\nThis is especially important in conditions when the growth of radicalism in the world is becoming a dangerous trend.\n\u00abStrengthening the coordination in promoting peace and the socio-economic reconstruction of Afghanistan should remain among the SCO\u2019s key priorities\u00bb, the President of Uzbekistan noted. The President stressed: \u00abThe Afghan people need our good-neighborly help more than ever. We must not repeat the mistakes of the past by leaving Afghanistan alone with its problems\u00bb.\nIn this regard, it was proposed to jointly create a special Humanitarian Support Fund for Afghanistan in our border city of Termez, making use of the modern infrastructure of the international transport and logistics hub established there. The funds shall be used to overcome the social crisis in this country, to implement the educational programs for youth and projects in healthcare.\nPresident Shavkat Mirziyoyev noted that cultural and humanitarian ties traditionally form a solid foundation for our cooperation.\u00a0Based on the principle of respect for the diversity of cultures, our Organization opens up the new opportunities for intercultural communication and exchange to the\u00a0 millions of people.\nBased on this, the Leader of Uzbekistan called for the establishment of additional formats as a part of the SCO, such as the Forum of University Rectors, the Days of Culture and Tourism, joint sports events and the Universiade. An initiative has also been put forward to launch digital platforms for intercultural dialogue: virtual museums, creative exhibitions, scientific videoconferences.\nIt was proposed to declare 2023 as the Year of Tourism Development to give a new impetus to cooperation in this area.\nThe President of Uzbekistan noted that since ancient times, Samarkand has been a center of spiritual, economic, cultural and scientific exchange among the peoples living in the space from East Asia to North Africa, the Middle East and Europe.\n\u00abOver the centuries a special culture of fruitful communication between the representatives of different civilizations has been created here.\u00a0Samarkand is a living example of how the principles of tolerance and respect for the traditions and the values of different peoples, which we took as a basis when creating the SCO, have been put into practice for centuries\u00bb, the President noted.\nIn this regard, the President of Uzbekistan put forward the Samarkand Solidarity Initiative for Common Security and Prosperity to the partners. Its goal is to involve in the global inter-civilizational dialogue all those who care about our common future, who are ready, regardless of differences, to seek agreed approaches and solutions, who share the principles of the \u00abSamarkand Spirit\u00bb.\nTo this end, the International Samarkand Forum will be held next year with the participation of political leaders, \u0435\u0440\u0443 authoritative public figures, business, academic and expert circles to jointly discuss the practical implementation of this initiative.\nIn conclusion of the speech, the President of Uzbekistan expressed the sincere gratitude for the active assistance in achieving the goals of Uzbekistan\u2019s chairmanship. \u00abI am confident that the documents and decisions adopted today will be a worthy contribution to the further progressive development and enhancement of the authority of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization\u00bb, the President of Uzbekistan noted.\nThe leaders of the member states, observer countries, honored guests, as well as the heads of the UN and SCO also addressed the SCO meeting.\nSource:\n\nInformation service of JSC \u00abNEG of Uzbekistan\u00bb\n", "creation_date": "18.09.2022", "access_date": "2024-03-10 00:16:03"},

Large-scale measures are being taken to modernize the industry, increase energy capacities and secure uninterrupted supply of electricity to consumers.\nIn accordance with a 1 February 2019 decree of the head of state, the Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Uzbekistan was established. The President\u2019s resolution on March 27 of the same year reorganized the joint stock company Uzbekenergo, setting up on its basis the joint-stock companies Issiqlik Elektr Stansiyalari (Thermal Power Plants), O\u2018zbekiston Milliy Elektr Tarmoqlari (National Power Grids of Uzbekistan) and Hududiy Elektr Tarmoqlari (Regional Power Grids).\nLast year, through the implementation of 6 major projects, a total of 1,076 megawatts of electricity generating capacities were put into operation.\nIt is expected that this year the volume of power consumption in Uzbekistan will be 71 billion kilowatt hours, which is 9 percent as much as last year. The demand across manufacturing industries is anticipated to grow by 10 percent, and 8.5 percent by household customers.\nThe meeting participants discussed measures to meet the abovementioned need, and the implementation of a corresponding \u00abroadmap\u00bb developed jointly with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.\nPresident Shavkat Mirziyoyev insisted that measures defined for the production, distribution and delivery of electricity in 2020 be executed in full and in high quality.\nPlans for this year include commissioning of additional capacities of 1177 megawatts in thermal energy and 120 megawatts in hydropower sector. Meanwhile, projects have been devised with foreign direct investment involving the construction of combined-cycle plants with a capacity of 3.5 thousand megawatts, wind power plants with 400 megawatts as well as solar power plants with the same capacity.\nSpecial emphasis was also placed at the meeting on ensuring profitability at the enterprises of the power industry and on eliminating debt for energy consumption. The introduction of an automated system for monitoring and accounting for electricity consumption and results therein have been qualified as efficient; the joint-stock company Hududiy Elekt Tarmoqlari was instructed to install another 4.5 million modern meters by the end of the year.\nThe President maintained that at the next stage of the industry reforms, it is important to create a competitive wholesale electricity market, attract investors to power generation on public-private partnership principles and a phased decline in state presence in the sector.\nThe meeting also served to deliberate on long-term prospects of the industry.\nCalculations show that by 2030, electricity consumption in Uzbekistan will be twice as much as the current level. In this regard, the Ministry of Energy was instructed to commission new thermal power stations with an aggregate capacity of 7.9 thousand megawatts over the next ten years.\nThe tasks were identified for the construction of solar and wind power plants with a total capacity of 8 thousand megawatts with the engagement of investors, thus bringing the propensity of hydroelectric mills to 1.935 thousand megawatts, and transferring orders for the construction of small water power stations to the private sector.\nThe head of our state instructed responsible agencies, together with the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Special Education, to elaborate five-year training programs for mid-level and lower-level specialists in the power sector able to work with modern technologies.\nHeads of industry enterprises reported on the issues discussed at the meeting, specific measures have been identified.\nAbout this and another in more detail in the report of the \u00abUzbekistan-24\u00bb channel.\n\nSource:\npresident.uz\nInformation Service of JSC \"National Electric Networks of Uzbekistan\"\n\nt.me/uzmetaxborotxizmati", "creation_date": "15.01.2020", "access_date": "2024-03-10 00:16:08"},

{"url": "https://www.uzbekistonmet.uz/en/lists/view/555", "title": "POWER INDUSTRY ENTERPRISES TO UNDERGO TRANSFORMATION", "text": "\nPresident Shavkat Mirziyoyev has held a meeting to discuss priority tasks in transforming electric power enterprises.\nThe starting point for systemic reforms in this sector was the 1 February 2019 decree of the head of our state defining measures to radically improve the management system of the fuel and energy industry of Uzbekistan. In accordance with the document, the Ministry of Energy was established with the separation of administrative and commercial functions of the sector management.\nAlong with this, under the 27 March 2019 resolution of the President on the strategy of further development and reforming of the electric power industry of Uzbekistan, Uzbekenergo JSC was dissolved to open way for three separate joint stock companies \u2013 Thermal Power Plants, National Electric Grids of Uzbekistan, and Regional Power Networks.\nFoundations for private investment in the energy sector have been created. As a result, within a year, on the basis of public-private partnership,\nprojects were launched to attract $ 2 billion in direct investment and the construction of 6 new power plants with a capacity of 2.7 thousand megawatts.\n\n\nAhead is a new stage of transformation, which requires solving problems of upgrading power plants, increasing energy efficiency, reducing costs and delivering a competitive electricity market.\n\n\nThe meeting participants discussed priority measures on these fronts. Attention was paid primarily to the issue of modernization of enterprises.\nToday, more than 50 percent of equipment at the country\u2019s power plants is outmoded. In addition, fuel consumption at old facilities is double the burning up at new combined-cycle plants.\nIn this regard, the President emphasized the need to continue modernization, but not by attracting funds under state guarantees, as it used to be the case until recently, but owing to private capital.\nShavkat Mirziyoyev insisted that joint-stock companies National Electric Grids of Uzbekistan, Regional Power Networks, Thermal Power Plants and Uzbekhydroenergo switch to a financial reporting system in accordance with world standards. This will prove an important factor in obtaining an international credit rating and issuing Eurobonds in the future. Building on these objectives, responsible officials have been instructed to devise a three-year financial model and business plans for the four companies mentioned above.\n\n\nDirectives were given on attracting foreign specialists to the boards and supervisory councils of enterprises to facilitate the transformation process.\nCurrently, due to the lack of rules for the operation of wholesale electricity market, long-term agreements on the purchase of energy at fixed prices are being concluded with investors.

Yet despite this, with all our hearts do we feel the joy and splendor of this holiday. It is marked with special enthusiasm in work teams, educational institutions and mahallas.\nFour years ago, relying on the provisions and principles of our Basic Law, we adopted the Actions Strategy and started delivering on extensive, accelerated democratic reforms. They have been built on the 7 amendments made to the Constitution, 5 codes and about 250 laws as the legal foundation.\nOver the past brief span of time, our society, the mindset of people has radically changed in political, legal and socio-economic terms, and every one of our fellow countrymen and women makes a commendable input into the advancement of our nation. All this is indicative of the vitality and tremendous potential of our Basic Law.\nToday, relying on this enormous power, our people courageously overcome hard trials and selflessly work for the sake of building a new Uzbekistan \u2013 a free, comfortable and prosperous life in the country.\n\nToday, the phrase New Uzbekistan is perceived of in the international arena not just as a new notion, but also as a reflection of reality.\nIndisputably, these achievements, themselves an outcome of the extensive legal opportunities enshrined in our Constitution, make us all feel specially proud.\nDear compatriots!\nOn the basis of the constitutional norm\n\u201cThe people are the sole source of state power\u201d\n, an effective and sustainable system is being formed to ensure the supremacy of the Constitution and laws, whereby it is not the people who serve government bodies, but the latter serve the former.\nAmid the current intricate times when the world has been changing rapidly, the system I have just mentioned, built on the norms of the Constitution, has fully justified itself in overcoming diverse trials and addressing new threats, the pandemic in particular, and in eliminating the consequences of natural and man-made disasters that took place earlier in the year in Bukhara and Syrdarya regions.\nWe have been implementing systemic democratic reforms that are irreversible and designed to ensure the principles of power of the people, social justice and humanism our Constitution is imbued with.\nFirst of all, our every effort is aimed to secure and realize every person\u2019s rights guaranteed by the Basic Law to receive qualified medical services and robust social protection.\nDuring the pandemic, priority is placed on protecting public health, helping out citizens who lost their jobs, and entrepreneurs. The established Anti-Crisis Fund has raised 10 trillion soums, which is directed at providing financial support for the healthcare system, social infrastructure, population and enterprises.\nDuring the passing year, more than 500 thousand entrepreneurs and over 8 million citizens have been provided with benefits in the amount of about 34 trillion soums, an additional 2.6 trillion soums were assigned to augment the size of social benefits, material assistance and boost employment.\nWithin the framework of the Affordable Housing State Program, once the most pressing social problem, more than 13 thousand of our compatriots were granted keys to new apartments this year alone.\nIn addition, a beautiful and modern town with multi-storey buildings and social infrastructure has been built for the families affected by the disaster at Sardoba reservoir.\nImbursement of initial payments for housing for more than 1,000 women who find themselves in difficult life situations is also among the kind actions.\nIn the course of spearheading proactive gender policy, accelerated work continues to improve the social and political status of women.\nAll of this helps to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic and the resulting economic and social crisis, as well as to bolster the confidence of our citizens in the future.\nDear compatriots!\nExtensive efforts are undertaken to ensure in practice the constitutional principle of justice. Thus, in order to reduce poverty, new effective mechanisms of social support are being introduced.\nIn accordance with home visit studies conducted to enquire into the problems the people have to endure, 840 billion soums were allocated to support more than 2.5 million members of over 590 thousand families. The needs, life problems of women and young people in every family were studied, employment has been provided for able-bodied members of almost 300 thousand families.\nCrucially, people develop the experience and skills to get out of poverty through self-employment, business skills and entrepreneurship.\nAnother vivid manifestation of humanism was the national movement Compassion and Support, set up during hard days for the nation by the business community, farmers and kindhearted citizens. As part of this movement, the categories of the population in need of social support received assistance in the amount of 204 billion soums.\nOn the basis of the principle\n\u201cNew Uzbekistan starts from the threshold of school\u201d\n, great attention is paid to radically reforming the education system. Large-scale work is underway to promote science, culture, arts, literature, sports, and swell the effectiveness of spiritual enlightenment activities, identify the abilities and talents of young people, especially girls.\nAll this serves to create foundation for the\nThird Renaissance\nin our country \u2013 a new era of our national development.\nProfound reforms are in progress in accordance with another important constitutional provision \u2013 ensuring human rights and interests in all walks of life, especially in the judicial and legal realm. This is confirmed by the fact that over the past four years, 2,600 citizens were acquitted, 2,400 were released from the courtroom, the number of judicial instances reduced from 7 to 3, the judicial system is formed on the basis of the principle of\n\u201cone court \u2013 one instance\u201d\n.\nThe National Human Rights Strategy is being implemented steadily.\nWork continues on the application of the institution of clemency. During the year 2020 alone, more than 300 persons who have committed crimes out of ignorance and sincerely repented of their deeds have been pardoned and released from penal institutions; for 200 persons, sentences have been reduced.\nPeople who did not have citizenship for a long time, now have become full-fledged citizens of the Republic of Uzbekistan. Over the past twenty-five years, the nationality was granted to only 482 persons, and at present, more than 50 thousand people are endowed with citizenship of our country. This will be a fitting response to the United Nations call for the importance of reducing the number of stateless persons.\nThanks to the elimination of restrictions related to the acquisition of real estate in the city of Tashkent and the Tashkent region, more than 40 thousand citizens were able to register housing purchased in the capital region under their name.\nDear compatriots!\nA consistent policy aimed at furthering the democratic reforms in Uzbekistan, ensuring human rights and freedoms, improving the wellbeing of the population is widely acknowledged by the world community.\nWhen one talks about this, notable is the international support for a number of global and regional initiatives and specific proposals put forward by Uzbekistan in September this year at the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly.\nFor the first time in the history of our nation, in October this year, Uzbekistan was elected member of the Human Rights Council \u2013 one of the principal bodies of the UN.\n\nThis is another great accomplishment of our open and proactive foreign policy.\nOwing to the improvement of the investment and business environment in the country, growth in tourism and export potential, the active implementation of standards and norms of the International Labor Organization, Uzbekistan\u2019s positions in international ratings are strengthening.\nDespite various obstacles and problems caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the global economic crisis, our external relations have not been interrupted. Ties with neighboring states and partner countries in the political, trade, economic, humanitarian spheres are developing.\nOur people are well aware that concrete measures have been taken this year to promptly and positively resolve the problems of Uzbek citizens abroad, provide them with legal assistance and bring them back home. Thus, amid the pandemic, more than 500 thousand of our citizens returned to the native land. Assistance of various kinds was provided to almost 100 thousand compatriots who found themselves in a tricky situation outside the country.\nHumanitarian activities continue to return our citizens, mainly women and children, who, falling on false promises, left the country and today are left face-to-face with difficulties in the Middle East, in the region caught under armed conflicts.\nIn this regard, I would like to emphasize again: the citizens of Uzbekistan will always be under the protection of their state and the Constitution, and we will continue to firmly adhere to this principle.\nDear friends!\nWe are all well aware that our achievements over the past four years are only the first steps towards the big goals we have set. On this path, we have to address very important tasks.\n\nFirst,\ntoday life itself requires perfection of the Constitution and laws. In particular, it is necessary to adopt laws that will serve the interests of the people, liberalize all spheres of our life, abolish legislative acts that do not meet the requirements of the time, optimize the regulatory framework, and reduce unnecessary norms regarding the regulation of business activities.\nI think the political parties and civil society institutions will participate even more actively in the implementation of these tasks.\n\nSecond,\nit is essential to devise and apply effective mechanisms to prevent and combat corruption, the principal enemy of our development.\nThe urgency of this issue is confirmed by the fact that over the past two years, a total of 1,986 officials have been brought to justice for crimes related to corruption, who by their illegal actions caused damage to the state in the amount of 2 trillion soums.\nTo systemically and comprehensively continue work in this direction, we are elaborating a\nNational Anti-Corruption Strategy for 2021\u20132025.\nI want to stress once again: this remains the most critical and priority objective for us. After all, corruption is an extremely dangerous challenge that destroys the state from within and damages our national security, and an uncompromising fight against this phenomenon is the duty of every one of us.\n\nThird,\nwe need to amplify attention to the issues of consolidating the peace, tranquility, interethnic harmony and interreligious tolerance, the protection of public order in the country. For the practical provision of the principle\n\u201cThe law is above everything, punishment for crime is inevitable\u201d\n, all the forces and capabilities of the law enforcement agencies will be mobilized.\n\nFourth\n, our priority task will continue to be to ensure the vital interests of our veterans, respected women and motivated youth, to strengthen the atmosphere of peace and cohesion in families, mahallas and in our multiethnic nation in general, where we all live as one family.\n\nFifth\n, we will step up efforts to ensure freedom of speech and press, independence of the media, and the establishment of public control over the activities of government authorities.\n\nEvery one of us must clearly understand that the processes of openness and transparency, pluralism of opinion and democratic renewal in our society have become as irreversible as the reforms carried out in all areas, and we will resolutely continue with this course.\nDear compatriots!\nTo steadily uplift the level and quality of life of our people, make it even more thriving and affluent so that every person in the country, regardless of ethnic origin, language and religion, feels the attention and care of the state and society is our key task.\nI am convinced that all our compatriots, uniting on the path to this noble goal, will become active builders of a new Uzbekistan.\nOnce again, I sincerely congratulate you on the Constitution Day, I wish you all a sound health, happiness, great success in life and activities for the benefit of society.\nMay peace and harmony always reign in our homes, in our beautiful country!\nMay all our good dreams and aspirations come true!\nShavkat Mirziyoyev,\nPresident of the Republic of Uzbekistan", "creation_date": "07.12.2020", "access_date": "2024-03-10 00:16:10"},

He cited a brick factory in Mubarek district that stole 4.3 million cubic meters of gas by unauthorized connection to an underground pipeline. This equals the volume of gas supply to as many as 8 thousand households.\nIn addition, this year, due to the installation of modern meters at major supply nodes in 74 districts, the theft of 7 million cubic meters of natural gas by more than 2 thousand wholesale consumers was revealed.\nGiven these facts, liability for illegal use of energy resources has been proposed to be toughened.\n\u201cHow are we going to spend winter this year?

Therefore, a special fund has been set up and $ 50 million allocated for guaranteed supplies of basic types of products to the domestic market.\nOfficials were instructed to use these funds to form reserves of basic foods for at least 3 months, first of all, vegetable oil and other vital products.

Today, national ideology is rather a critical issue in our country, which is moving along the path of building a new life and joining the ranks of advanced nations.\n\nIn recent years, a number of decisions have been made in this direction. It was determined that the President of the country chairs the Republican Council for Ethics and Enlightenment. Hokims head the local offices of the council. This fact has helped to further elevate the role of ethical enlightenment issues in policy agenda.\n\n\n\u201cEconomy is an organism that ensures the vital activity of society, while ethical enlightenment is its heart and soul,\u201d Shavkat Mirziyoyev noted at the meeting. \u201cSince we have decided to build a new Uzbekistan, we rely on two strong pillars. The first is a robust economy built on market principles. The second is a dedicated ethical enlightenment based on the rich spiritual heritage of our ancestors and national values.\u201d\nDuring Shavkat Mirziyoyev\u2019s recent Address to the Oliy Majlis, at the first Youth Forum of Uzbekistan and the expanded format session of the Security Council, pressing tasks in the field of ethical enlightenment were formulated, since scores of issues await solution in the sphere. Some do not fully understand the essence of the national idea, treat it superficially, mistakenly identifying it with the old ideology. In this regard, the President outlined the pivot of our country\u2019s ideology:\n\u201cThe ideology of the new Uzbekistan we are building will be kindness, compassion, humanism. When we talk about ideology, we mean, first of all, nurturing of reason, fostering of national and universal values. They are built on millennia-old life principles and ideas and values \u200b\u200bof our people,\u201d the head of state insisted.\n\n\nConfrontation and competition in the world as well as clash of interests have been mounting. Globalization processes bring both unprecedented new opportunities and unforeseen problems for humanity. Threats and challenges to national identity and spiritual values have also been growing in scope. Egocentrism, carefree attitude to work, family, consumer culture are being introduced in various ways into the minds of people, especially young ones.\nThreats such as terrorism, extremism, transnational and cybercrime, human and drug trafficking are on the rise. In some regions, artificially bolstered instability and protest moods are observed.\nIn such an alarming situation, it is necessary to exercise prudence and vigilance, to live with the peace and interests of our country in mind.\nThe head of state stressed that the biggest threat is indifference and unresponsiveness, in minimizing the social problems observed today, there is not enough participation of the older generation in enlightenment work, and public control is insufficient.\nThe time itself requires a scientifically grounded analysis of the social and spiritual situation in society, it was noted. It is the absence of such an approach to the organization of spiritual and educational work that does not allow achieving the expected results.\nIn this respect, the need for critical study and radical improvement of the work of the Republican Center for Ethical Enlightenment was indicated.\nThe President proposed to establish Social and Ethical Enlightenment Research Institute on the basis of the Manaviyat Targibotchisi educational institution of the Republican Center for Ethical Enlightenment.\nMeasures have been identified to bring spiritual and enlightenment work to a qualitatively and substantively new level.\nToday, dozens of organizations are involved in the promotion of ethical enlightenment. Due to the lack of clear coordination of their activities, of an integrated system, there are cases of duplication of work.\nIt was determined that from now on, the Republican Center for Ethical Enlightenment will coordinate the spiritual and educational activities of all territorial councils, ministries, agencies and organizations.\nMaterial and technical support for the Center and its organizations will be significantly boosted. The research and propaganda work of the Center will be reorganized.\nThere should be no break in education, our people say. However, in ethical enlightenment efforts today the situation is far from that ideal. Kindergartens, schools, higher education, mahalla \u2013 each link works in this direction on its own.\nIn this regard, the importance of delivering a unified system of ethical enlightenment work, in particular, the upbringing of boys and girls as educated and virtuous individuals from childhood, and providing methodological assistance to preschool educational institutions for this purpose, was emphasized.\nInstructions were given on uplifting the effectiveness of spiritual and educational work in schools, secondary specialized and higher educational institutions. In all universities and their branches, the post of vice-rector for youth issues and ethical enlightenment work will be introduced.\nParticular attention was paid to ensuring the stability of the social and spiritual situation in mahallas. It was suggested that under the scheme \u201cIntelligentsia is the spiritual patron of the mahalla\u201d, professors, teachers and celebrated representatives of the intelligentsia will be assigned to each mahalla. The President supported the initiative of representatives of the senior generation to assist youth with difficult upbringing and unemployed ones.\n\n\nAn executive order was given to build standard-design centers of ethical enlightenment in regions, to allocate additional staff units to the sphere at the expense of local budgets.\nA proposal has been made to turn the Victory Park complex in Tashkent into a research center for the study of military history and the heroism of our ancestors.\nShavkat Mirziyoyev highlighted the importance of upbringing the growing generation in the spirit of patriotism and national pride. To do this, it is necessary to take history teaching onto a new level and enhance academic research in this area.\n\u201cIt is essential to teach national history in a national spirit. Otherwise, there will be no educational effect. We must teach our youth to learn lessons from history, draw conclusions, equip them with historical science, historical thinking,\u201d Shavkat Mirziyoyev insisted.\nResponsible officials were tasked with devising a concept for the development of historical science in Uzbekistan through to 2030.\nThe President instructed the executives to bolster the status of Uzbek as a state language, introduce modern technologies for its study in the country and abroad.\nToday, life demands to think and work in a new way, to foster national \u2018think tanks\u2019. Unfortunately, there are few analysts and experts in Uzbekistan who are capable of deeply researching and communicating in an understandable language all the socio-political processes taking place around us. In this respect, the necessity was stressed to radically revise the academic and applied research work in the field of protecting society from ethical threats. It was emphasized that the centers of ethical enlightenment, Development Strategy, Islamic Civilization, research institutes of social and humanitarian orientation should turn into such think tanks.\n\n\nIn order to promote the national idea, increase the efficiency of ethical enlightenment \u00a0work, and further develop literature and culture of reading in society, a Fund for the Support of Ethical Enlightenment and Creativity will be established on the basis of the Ijod public foundation.\n120 billion soums will be allocated for these purposes, to be spent on the effective implementation of spiritual and educational work, development of national literature. Of this amount, 90 billion soums will be directed to the development of the spiritual and educational sphere in regions, 20 billion soums \u2013 to support the activities of the Writers Union, 10 billion soums \u2013 to effectively organize ethical enlightenment work at the national scale.\nThe President instructed to include the majors in ethical enlightenment in the classifier of educational disciplines, to organize the training of highly qualified personnel in this direction.\nParticular attention received issues of improving the culture of reading, consistent development of cinematography, a critical analysis of the activities of art councils at all TV channels, and raising the quality of television programs.\n\u201cThe idea that the issue of spiritual education is only the work of the Ethical Enlightenment Center or a certain ministry, department, is misleading. This is, on the contrary, one of the most critical, vital tasks facing all of us,\u201d the President stressed.\nOfficials responsible for the sphere, teachers and professors, ministers and hokims of regions expressed their views and proposals on the issues discussed at the videoconference session.\nSource:\n", "creation_date": "22.01.2021", "access_date": "2024-03-10 00:16:11"},

In accordance with the document, Republican Commission chaired by the Prime Minister was formed, specific tasks of all responsible government bodies for preparing for the winter were defined. Consistent efforts are underway to ensure uninterrupted supply of private homes, social institutions and enterprises with heat, and repair boiler rooms and networks.\nThe meeting participants analyzed the activities of enterprises in the fuel and energy complex, and identified further measures.\nIt was noted that it is imperative to meet the energy needs of the population and sectors of the economy in the autumn-winter period, which requires effective implementation of a program to increase natural gas production. The Cabinet of Ministers, the Ministry of Energy were instructed to maximize the opportunities available to meet the needs of consumers.\nThe Uztransgaz and Hududgaztaminot joint-stock companies were tasked with completing the overhaul and reconstruction of 93 kilometers of gas pipelines and 172 gas distribution points by November 1 this year, and creating a gas reserve in underground storage facilities. The importance of launching new compressor stations at the Mubarekneftegaz and Gazlineftegazdobycha enterprises was indicated.\nIn the fall-winter season, 245 thousand tons of liquefied gas is scheduled to deliver to the population. The President insisted at the meeting that the needs of the population be deeply studied in the context of each region and, if necessary, additional volumes of liquefied gas be delivered.\nShavkat Mirziyoyev instructed the officials to put into operation new and upgrade the existing capacities for producing propane-butane mixture at the Mubarek Gas Processing Plant, the Gazlineftegazdobycha and Shurtanneftegaz enterprises.\nIt is expected that in the coming season the demand for electricity will increase by 11.5 percent compared to last year.\nIn this regard, the Ministry of Energy has been instructed to provide, in October, for the overhaul of 7 power units, 7 boiler units, 1 gas turbine and 1 combined cycle plant (CCP) in thermal power stations.\nIt is essential, as it was underlined, to commission the second 450 MW combined cycle plant at the Navoi Thermal Power Station before the end of this year, bring the first CCP unit to the design capacity and launch the second such installation at the Turakurgan Thermal Power Station. Measures for reconstruction and modernization of 3,500 kilometers of power networks and 1,171 transformer points by December this year were defined.\nThe ministries of energy and finance, the joint-stock company Uzbekiston Temir Yollari have been instructed to fully meet the population\u2019s need for coal in the autumn-winter months. Special attention is to be attached to prevent excessive growth in coal prices for the population, and therefore transportation privileges should be applied.\nThe meeting served also to discuss the state of readiness of drinking water supply and heat supply networks for the fall-winter season. The leadership of the Ministry of Housing and Public Utility Services and local hokimiyats were seriously criticized for the deficiencies in this area. They were tasked with speeding up and completing the works on repairing the heat and water supply systems and apartment buildings within a brief span of time.\n\nPress service of\u00a0 Joint Stock Company\n\u00abNational Power Grid Of Uzbekistan\u00bb\n\n", "creation_date": "05.09.2019", "access_date": "2024-03-10 00:16:13"},

The project will improve the performance of the National Electric Grid of Uzbekistan (NEGU) to ensure reliable energy supplies to millions of households and businesses across the country.\nThe project will be supported by $380 million in credit from the International Development Association (IDA), and a $43 million loan from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) under the\u00a0 Sustainable Renewables Risk Mitigation Initiative Facility. The Government of Uzbekistan will receive this financing at very low-interest rates and with the longest repayment period of up to 40 years. The GCF will also provide a $4 million grant to cover selected project activities.\nIn Uzbekistan, electricity demand is expected to grow to over 100 TWh by 2030, a significant increase from 61 TWh in 2018. The country has more than 250,000 km of electricity transmission and distribution lines, most of which were built during the Soviet period and are now past their useful economic life. The obsolete infrastructure results in high electricity losses, estimated at 20 percent of net generation, and frequent power outages undermining economic activities and the well-being of citizens across the country.\n\n\u201cThis new transformational project supports the Government\u2019s goal of removing barriers to the effective operation and growth of the electricity sector. It will create the conditions for transforming the NEGU into a modern and commercially run company and modernizing the national power transmission system. These measures will ensure reliable electricity supply for approximately 32 million consumers and, importantly, enable the grid integration of new large-scale renewable energy generation projects,\u201d\nsaid Marco Mantovanelli, World Bank Country Manager for Uzbekistan.\nThe project will help modernize outdated energy infrastructure by financing a part of NEGU\u2019s priority investment program. Among other activities, it will include rehabilitation, upgrade, and expansion of 22 existing obsolete high-voltage substations and construction of a new 500 kV transmission substation and associated transmission lines in 11 regions of Uzbekistan.\nThe project will introduce modern digital and telecommunication technologies and solutions to improve the process of monitoring, control, and operation of the power transmission system. This will include the installation of a new Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Energy Management System (EMS) for the NEGU\u2019s central and regional dispatch centers to replace the outdated systems placed in operation during the Soviet era.\nGiven the company\u2019s strategic role in the electricity sector, the project will support the transformation of the NEGU by developing its business processes, financial, operational, and commercial performance, digitalization, as well as institutional capacity. This will include activities to improve the company\u2019s operation and planning functions, corporate governance and decision-making processes, and cybersecurity management.\nThe project aims to support the country in its clean energy transition by improving the transmission network\u2019s capacity to integrate renewable energy produced by the private sector. It will contribute to the Government\u2019s plans to decarbonize the electricity sector. The project will directly support the integration of 1,500 MW of renewable energy into the power grid leading to additional CO2 emissions reduction. It will also help mobilize private investments in the country\u2019s renewable energy sector.\nThe project will build foundations to transit to a competitive electricity market in Uzbekistan through supporting initial steps towards introducing operations based on market principles. It will also contribute to the development of regional electricity trade in Central Asia by rehabilitating and expanding transmission infrastructure connecting Uzbekistan with Afghanistan, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan\u2019s electricity systems.\nThe project was prepared with a $350,000 grant from the Europe and Central Asia Regional Capacity Development Trust Fund and a $500,000 grant from the Program for Asia Connectivity and Trade. It was informed by the Support for Preparation of Energy Sector Strategy programmatic technical assistance co-funded by the World Bank-led Energy Sector Management Assistance Program.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "creation_date": "28.06.2021", "access_date": "2024-03-10 00:16:16"},

You are immediately involved in decision-making on tackling the problems of Afghanistan and rendering assistance to the Afghan people.\nWe are pleased to see in our forum the heads of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Economic Cooperation Organization, as well as the representatives of international financial institutions and leading analytical centers.\nWe welcome the high-profile Afghan delegation led by the acting Minister of Foreign Affairs Amir Khan Muttaqi, which is participating at the forum.\nWe believe that this Conference shall promote a constructive exchange of views in terms of building up the interactions with the new authorities of Afghanistan based on a comprehensive consideration of interests of the Afghan people and the world community as a whole.\n\nDistinguished participants of the Conference!\n\nFor over a space of millennia the Uzbek and Afghan people lived side by side with one another. We share the common cultural, spiritual and historical values, one religion and the heritage of great ancestors.\nIt should be underscored that without a stability on the other bank of Amudarya, it is impossible to achieve security and stable development in Uzbekistan and the entire Central Asian region.\nIn this regard, it cannot but arouse concern that the attention is getting reduced in the world to Afghanistan, which is facing deep socio-economic and humanitarian crisis in its newest history.\nWe are convinced that today the international community won\u2019t repeat the mistakes of the 1990s, shall be able to avoid them and this goal should certainly be achieved.\nThe international isolation of Afghanistan shall inevitably lead to further deterioration of the humanitarian situation. Thus, it is important not to allow for this, since the point is about the fate of millions of people.\nAt the moment, the Interim government of Afghanistan takes the certain steps in terms of peaceful reconstruction of the country, strives to improve the socio-economic situation, establish the friendly relations with neighboring countries and the mutually beneficial cooperation with an international community. We must foster and endorse these efforts.\nMeanwhile, forming a broad representation of all layers of the Afghan society in state governance, ensuring basic human rights and freedoms, especially of women and all ethnic-confessional groups remain a fundamental condition for establishing a lasting peace in Afghanistan.\nWe call on the current government of Afghanistan to show a firm will and take resolute measures to prevent and counteract terrorism in all of its forms and manifestations, break up the ties with all international terrorist organizations.\nSuch approach shall lead up to consolidation of trust to an Interim government, open up the real prospects for a stable development of Afghanistan in an atmosphere of friendship, good neighborliness and mutually beneficial cooperation with its nearest surrounding states and the international community.\n\nDear friends!\n\nThe Special resolution adopted recently by the UN General Assembly on strengthening connectivity between the Central and South Asia has also confirmed the most important significance of preserving peace in Afghanistan to ensure the international security.\nAll of us, the entire international community, must show solidarity with the Afghan people. We should direct our efforts to creating the real prerequisites for Afghanistan to become a peaceful, stable and prosperous land \u2013 free from terrorism, wars and narcotics.\nOur common priority must become a recovery of Afghanistan\u2019s economy. It is such an approach, which is considered an important condition for achieving a solid peace in this long-suffering country. In particular, this direction includes its integration into inter-regional economic processes, implementation of the infrastructure and socially significant projects.\nAt the moment, Uzbekistan is making a tangible contribution to the international efforts on rendering assistance to the socio-economic and humanitarian recovery of Afghanistan, including through promotion of the large trans-regional infrastructure projects.\nIn conclusion, I would like to express hope that today\u2019s Conference shall become an effective platform for productive discussions and development of concerted approaches, which correspond to the interests and aspirations of the people of Afghanistan.\nI wish success to the work of the Conference and all of its participants.\n\nShavkat Mirziyoyev\nThe President of the Republic of Uzbekistan\n\n\nInformation service of JSC \u00abNEG of Uzbekistan\u00bb\n", "creation_date": "26.07.2022", "access_date": "2024-03-10 00:16:17"},

In the simulation laboratories of the Institute's training center, the processes at the substation were created virtually, and the substation was controlled online.\nFirst day of the trip\nOn the first day of the business trip, employees of NEGU visited the training center of the Hitachi Energy Switzerland Ltd Institute in Baden, Switzerland. At the beginning of the training session, a presentation about the Hitachi Energy Switzerland Ltd Institute and its activities was shown. During the presentation, special attention was paid to the production of power devices, relay protection devices, automation and communication for substations, as well as special software for monitoring and control, including LUMADA APM, LUMADA EAM and LUMADA FSM programs.\nAfter that, qualified specialists of the training center provided basic information on the introduction of digital technologies in the electric power industry, \u201cdigital solutions\u201d, digital telecommunication systems and digital management.\nLUMADA is Hitachi's suite of advanced digital data solutions, services and technologies to drive digital innovation. This complex can receive primary data from SCADA, ERP, own systems such as LUMADA APM, LUMADA EAM and LUMADA FSM for analysis and recommendations.\nSecond day of the trip\nThe main topic of the classes on the second day of the service trip was acquaintance with the international standard IEC 61850 and types of synchronization in the substation.\nIEC 61850 is an international standard that defines communication protocols for communication between various devices located in a substation, such as protection, control and measurement equipment, and intelligent electronic devices (IEDs).\nSince its first version, this standard substation has made great strides in managing communication networks and systems.\nCommunication protocols IEC 61850\nWhile Internet Protocol frameworks provide a secure way to transfer data, they are relatively slow for real-time systems. Therefore, this standard speeds up the process for different protocols:\n\u21d2\nMMS ( Manufacturing Messaging Specification - specification of production messages):\nwidely used for configuration monitoring and data exchange between microprocessor devices and a SCADA system;\n\u21d2\nGOOSE ( Generic Object - Oriented Substation Events - general object-oriented substation events):\nused for mutual exchange of messages between microprocessor devices;\n\u21d2\nSV ( Sampled Measured Values - selective measured values):\nprovides fast and reliable transmission of measurement, protection and control values from current and voltage transformers in the power system.\nIEC 61850 describes how devices interact in a substation and the corresponding system requirements. Time synchronization (Timesync) is the synchronization of the date and time of all devices on the network. Synchronization is very important in time sensitive digital substation applications. This indicator is listed as an important requirement of the IEC 61850 standard.\nThird day of the trip\nOn the third day of the tour, we studied the architecture of a digital substation. At the same time, the control of power devices at a digital substation was modeled (performed) in a special laboratory.\nThe substation system architecture is divided into 4 levels:\n1) Network level\n- network level;\n2) Station level\n\u2014 the station level where operations, engineering functions and reporting take place;\n3) Bay level\n\u2014 the bay level where system protection and control functions are implements;\n4) Process level\n\u2014 the process level where signals from CTs and other transducers are transmitted.\nThe switching process at the substation was created virtually in the simulator laboratory of the training center. In this case, it is important to first provide the program with a description of the devices, the relationship of switching devices and the sequence of their connection.\nFourth day of the trip\nThe next day of the business trip was devoted to the study and analysis of the workflow of the Merging Unit, which is the main element of the digital substation.\nThe analog signal converter block is designed to collect analog signals from voltage and current transformers and transfer data in digital form to other relay protection devices and process control systems.\nFifth day of the trip\nOn the last day of training, testing and certification laboratories, communication and cybersecurity centers of the Hitachi Energy Switzerland Ltd Institute were visited and their activities were studied.\nIn conclusion: today, when information technologies and digital programs are developing at a rapid pace, an urgent task is to introduce digital technologies and digital substations into the energy system of Uzbekistan based on world experience.\nReporter on behalf of the team of specialists sent on mission:\nIsmoil Abduganiyev, Specialist of the Projects Implementation Group (PIU) of JSC National Electric Grid of Uzbekistan\nInformation Service of NEGU\n\n", "creation_date": "01.08.2022", "access_date": "2024-03-10 00:16:17"},
